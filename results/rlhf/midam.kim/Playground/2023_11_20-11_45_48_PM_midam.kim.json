Violets are small flowers, while elephants are large mammals. They live in vastly different environments, with violets growing in the ground and elephants living in forests and grasslands. Their physical characteristics also differ greatly: violets have thin stems and delicate petals, whereas elephants have thick skin, tusks, and huge ears.\n\nHowever, there is one interesting similarity between them that can be observed through their names. Both \"violet\" and \"elephant\" contain the letter \"e\". This repetition of the same letter gives both words a similar sound when pronounced aloud.", "snaprejected": "They're both big and grey."}]
