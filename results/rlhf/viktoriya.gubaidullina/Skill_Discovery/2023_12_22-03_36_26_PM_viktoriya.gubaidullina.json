Those are unique values that need to be retrieved for a particular intent.\nEach entity has 'entity-id' and  entity-description. It may  have ''example-values' which  mean that extracted entities can deviate from those  mentioned in schema, but should be similar. If multiple entities are provided, fill all the entities.
