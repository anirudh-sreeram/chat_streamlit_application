Each category has its name and description.  For each category there are also attributes and their values. Attributes can be retrieved for a particular skill if requested explicitly. Attributes have their unique  ID in alphanumeric format and attribute description. It can also include \"Attribute-Example-values\", which means the attribute must match one of the provided values. \n\t2.
