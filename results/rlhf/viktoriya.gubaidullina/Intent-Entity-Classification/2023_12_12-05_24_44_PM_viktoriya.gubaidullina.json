[{"role": "user", "content": "# Utterance:\n\nUrgent announcement! \nDear colleagues ,\nplease be aware that some of our conference rooms, specifically : Asimov, the Creativity Cove, Albert Einstein, Marie Curie and Galileo Galilei\n will be temporally unavailable  starting 02.11.2021 due to urgent maintenance required to address a persisting ventilation issue that has been identified as a potential risk to both the functionality and safety of the room. \n\nDuring this period the access to the meeting rooms will be restricted to allow the maintenance team to conduct necessary repairs and improvements. The anticipated duration of the maintenance is 6 weeks. \nAs a result, all reservations for the conference rooms affected need to be rescheduled or relocated to alternative spaces.\n\nShould any concerns or questions regarding this maintenance, please do not hesitate to contact Facilities Manager Robert Dow.\n\nWe understand the inconvenience this may cause and sincerely apologize for the short notice. Your flexibility and understanding during this unforeseen circumstance are greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you for your cooperation.\nBest regards.\n\n# List of intents:\n\n[\n    {\n
