Here is the list of the most common claims cases for airline companies. Each intent ( claim case type)  has its code id, claim name, claim description and the amount due to the passenger, if applicable. There is also a list of important mandatory details that a customer should include when submitting a claim.\nIntents: Each intent has a unique ID, a code, associated with it, that consists of two, three or four uppercase letters and intent description. Please acquaint yourself with the specific definition of each intent by reading the descriptions associated with each intent and understanding the constraints required for each intent.\nSlots: For each intent there are also slots associated with them.  Slots are values that need to be retrieved for a particular intent.  Each slot will have a  unique ID that starts with1 lower case letter followed by 3 numbers,  name and description. It could also include a field exampleValues where examples are given but the extracted slots do not need to exactly match those given values.  \n\nGo through the information available in the utterance provided below and extract all relevant slots and their values. To give the correct answer use the list of the intents (types of claims) provided above.  If multiple slots are provided, extract only those that present in the utterance. If some slots that are present in the utterance were not provided in the list above, ignore them and do not extract. Do not extract slots that have values \"n/a\" in their descriptions. \nReturn your answer in json.\nThe JSON should always have a key \u201coutput\u201d. The value of \u201coutput\u201d should be a dictionary where the key of this dictionary is the intent id and the values is a sub-dictionary where the keys are the slots associated with the given intent and the values are the slot values. \nExtract the slots and their possible values only if the relevant intent was assigned to the utterance.\n\n# Utterance:\n\n\"On 21st of January this year I flew with Blue Emerald Airways from San Diego to Paris, flight # MK748, and  upon arrival at my destination, I discovered that my baggage was missing.  At  SkyWing airport, I immediately submitted a PIR form with number WinA147_02. But my luggage was never found. I had to purchase new stuff for the duration of my business trip and the bill comes up to 2,100 usd. I expect you to provide me with compensation I'm entitled by the law.
