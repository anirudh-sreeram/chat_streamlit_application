intent has a unique ID, associated with it, that consists of 1 uppercase letter, 1 lowercase letter, 1 uppercase letter, 1 lowercase letter and 2 numbers, a name and intent description. Please acquaint yourself with the specific definition of each intent by reading the descriptions associated with each intent and understanding the constraints required for each intent.\nSlots:\nFor each intent there are also slots associated with them.  Slots are values that need to be retrieved for a particular intent.  Each slot will have a  unique ID that starts with 2 upper case letters, 3  lower case letters, followed by 2 numbers,  name, datatype, and description. It may also include  possibleValues which means the slot must match one of the provided values.   It could also include a field exampleValues where examples are given but the extracted slots do not need to exactly match those given values.  \n\nGo through the information available the utterance below and assign the relevant intent. To give the correct answer use the list of the intents provided above.\nImportant:  You should ignore all other intents if present in the utterance. If they are not mentioned in the list provided above, do not extract those intent. If you do not obey, you'll be penalized. Also extract all relevant slots and their values. If multiple slots are provided, fill all the slots.  If a slot value is not provided, set the value of the slot to \"none\".  If some slots that are present in the utterance were not provided, ignore them and do not extract.\n\nReturn your answer in json.\nThe JSON should always have a key \u201coutput\u201d. The value of \u201coutput\u201d should be a dictionary where the key of this dictionary is the intent id and the values is a sub-dictionary where the keys are the slot ids associated with the given intent and the values are the slot values. If intent can't be identified, please return: {\"prediction_intent\": \"None\"}.\n\n# Utterance:\n\t\nIngrid,\nI'd like to bring to your attention that regrettably, there has been a double booking for the Asimov conference room for 20.09.21 at 3:00 pm. Our team had previously reserved the space for the  presentation of the sprint results. However, it has come to our attention that another team also has the reservation for the same time. Could we discuss and potentially reschedule our meeting or find an alternative space that works for everyone involved? Also, can you order some drinks for the next team meeting?
