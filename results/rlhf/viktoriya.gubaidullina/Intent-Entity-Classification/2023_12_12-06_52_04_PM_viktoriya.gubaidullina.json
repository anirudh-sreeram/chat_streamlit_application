Intents have Intent Ids, name and intent description.  Intent Ids always start with 2 upper case letters, 1 lower case letter, 3 numbers. For each intent there are also slots associated with them.  Slot Id contains 3 numbers and 1 upper case letter.  It may also include a field possibleValues which means the slot must match one of the provided values.\n\nI ask you to assign a relevant intent to the utterance. When making the decision also extract slots that associated with this intent.  If multiple slots are provided in the list above, fill only slots  that are present in the utterance.  If a slot is not provided, set the value of the slot to \"none\".\n\nGive your final output as a JSON.  Be sure to include a key \u201cprediction\u201d.  The value of \u201cprediction\u201d should be a dictionary where the key of this dictionary is the intent id and the values is a sub-dictionary where the keys are the slot ids associated with the given intent and the values are the slot values. Be attentive and extract all values for each slot if multiple can be found in the utterance.\nAttention: Do not extract any slots and their values if they were not given in the list provided above.   All possible slots keys should be present in the JSON for a given intent. If the output is not within this format, you will be heavily penalized. \n\n# Utterance:\n\n\"With this email I'm requesting the cancellation of my scheduled appointment with Dr. Anne Robin-Smith on December 12, 2021 at 11:35 am due to unforeseen circumstances.\nI have encountered a sudden family emergency that requires my immediate attention and presence.  Unfortunately, I'm unable to keep appointment as planned. I deeply apologize for any inconvenience caused by this cancellation. I'm aware of the cancellation fee in the amount of $84 and will gladly pay them at my next visit of the clinic. \nWarm regards,\nTaras Bulba\"", "tags": ["input_Freeform", "input_Lists", "input_Markdown", "task_combination", "output_JSON", "subtask_multi_entity", "subtask_single_intent", "response_bad_incomplete", "response_bad_incorrect", "complexity_type_meta_instructions", "complexity_type_input_format", "complexity_type_multiple_subtasks", "complexity_type_multiple_input_formats", "complexity_type_noise", "num_intents_4", "prompt_complex"]}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "{\n    \"prediction\": {\n        \"CAp903\": {\n            \"788B\": [\n                \"Dr. Anne Robin-Smith\",\n                \"Taras Bulba\",\n                \"December 12, 2021 at 11:35 am \"\n            ],\n            \"323F\": \"Email\"\n        }\n    }\n}", "rejected": "{\n    \"prediction\": {\n        \"CAp903\": {\n            \"788B\": \"Taras Bulba\",\n            \"323F\": \"Email\",\n            \"none\": \"none\",\n            \"none\": \"none\"\n        }\n    }\n}", "model": "NOW_LLM_llama13b_convclass_dpo_12723_nonpairwise_loss"}]
