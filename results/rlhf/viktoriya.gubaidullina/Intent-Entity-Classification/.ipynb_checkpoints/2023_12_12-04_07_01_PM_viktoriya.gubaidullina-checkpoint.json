Intents have Intent Ids, name and intent description. For each intent there are also slots associated with them.  Each slot will have a name, datatype, and description. It may also include a field possibleValues which means the slot must match one of the provided values.\n\nTo begin with, Your task will be to find in the list  provided above those intents that fit the following condition:\nIntent Id should start with 2 upper cases letters, 1 lower case letters and 4 numbers.\nNext, if there are several intents that have Ids in the format requested, you should choose the one that matches best the utterance below.\nDo not extract Intent Id. Please return only slots and their values. If multiple slots are provided in the list above, fill all the slots.  If a slot is not provided, set the value of the slot to \"none\".\n\nGive your final output as a JSON.  The JSON should always have a key \u201coutput\u201d.  The value of \u201coutput\u201d should be a dictionary where the key of this dictionary is the slot ids associated with the given intent and the values are the slot values.  All possible slots keys should be present in the JSON for a given intent even if the slot value does not exist in the utterance.  If the output is not within this format, you will be heavily penalized. \n\n# Utterance\n\nSubject: Urgent attention required : Audio issue in the conference room.\n\n\"Dear Charlotte,\nI wanted to bring to your attention the situation occurred during recent meeting with important client in the conference room Aldebaran on the 5th floor. Regrettably, there was a significant disturbance throughout the meeting. The speakers emitted a persistent scratching sound, rendering the conversation incomprehensible for all attendees. As a result, important discussions were  muffled due to this technical glitch.\nI'd like to empathize the importance of those meeting with clients. Meeting in person provides deeper insights into client\u2019s needs, preferences, and expectations. Observing their environment, work culture, and non-verbal cues enables better tailoring of services to their specific requirements.\n\nCould you please address this matter promptly and arrange for a technical inspection of the audio equipment in Aldebaran? We wish to ensure that future gathering are free from  such disruptions.\n\nIf there's any additional information needed ot if I cn assist in  anyway to facilitate the process, please don't hesitate to reach out.\n\nThank you in advance for your understanding and assistance.\n\nBest regards,\nTom Soyyer\nProduct Manager\"\n", "tags": ["input_Freeform", "input_Markdown", "input_JSON", "task_entity_extraction", "output_JSON", "num_intents_4", "prompt_complex", "response_bad_incorrect", "complexity_type_adding_conditionals", "complexity_type_input_format", "complexity_type_multiple_input_formats", "complexity_type_noise", "complexity_type_meta_instructions"]}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "{\n    \"output\": {\n        \"FMicr11\": \"none\",\n        \"IAset12\": \"none\",\n        \"FSpea13\": \"scratching_sound\"\n    }\n}", "rejected": "{\n    \"output\": {\n        \"FMicr11\": \"scratching_sound\",\n        \"IAset12\": \"none\",\n        \"FSpea13\": \"scratching_sound\"\n    }\n}", "model": "NOW_LLM_llama13b_convclass_dpo_12723_pairwise_loss"}]
