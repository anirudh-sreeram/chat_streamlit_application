I've attempted to reach out to Paywish Select online three times but haven't received any response.\n I opted for active Favorites vouchers worth  180.. However, while at Decathlon, one of the merchants listed on the card, I was informed that the vouchers are fraudulent and there are ongoing lawsuits involving Paywish Select and Decathlon.\n\nI had intended to use the vouchers at Decathlon to purchase school clothes and trainers for my son. However, I had to pay for the items using my bank card and left the store feeling utterly embarrassed.\n\nI would appreciate it if my balance could be transferred back so that I can choose a different card or store. Considering how close it is to Christmas, this  180 would have been immensely helpful. I truly hope to hear from you soon and am hopeful that you can assist me promptly.\n\n\nBest regards\n\nSiena Hobbs\nPA to Gavin Hahn, Global Chief Technology Officer, Simcrop Asset Management\n\n[cid:image001.gif@01D90404.4AEEA8D9]\n\n+45 7734 680 503\n\n[cid:image002.gif@01D90404.4AEEA8D9]\n\n+45 131 549 3568\n\n[cid:image003.png@01D90404.4AEEA8D9]\n\nSiena.Hobbs@simcrop.com<mailto:Siena.Hobbs@simcrop.com>\n\n[cid:image004.png@01D90303.4AEEA8D09\nSimcrop Asset Management, 7 Nicholson St. Footscray, EI13 9SB\n\n[cid:image005.png@01D90303.4AEEA8D9]<http://www.simcrop.com/>\n\nwww.simcrop.com<http://www.simcrop.com/>\n\n[cid:image006.gif@01D90303.4AEEA8D9]<https://uk.jobwise.com/company/simcrop>\n\nConnect with us on Jobwise at www.jobwise.com/company/simcrop<http://www.jobwise.com/company/simcrop>\n\n[An image featuring a card with an automatically granted text Description ]\n\nI advocate for inclusivity and diversity.\n\n[An image displaying a sign with an automatically generated Description]<http://www.simcrop.com/>\n\n\nHelp us protect the environment - please refrain from printing this email unless necessary.\nThis email is private and intended solely for the recipient.
