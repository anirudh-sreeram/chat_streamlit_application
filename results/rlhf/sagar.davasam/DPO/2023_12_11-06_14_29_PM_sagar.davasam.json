There might also be challenges associated with assigning proper permissions to these users. The customers have reached out for assistance in resolving these issues.\nWhat actions were taken to address the issue?\n- Added three new users (J. Walsh, T. Cad, and F. Whitney) to the Cardly account.\n- Assigned full permissions to these users.\n- Encountered difficulty in granting the users access to specific aspects of the system, namely SysProd order transactions and the ability to place orders independently.\n- Requested assistance from Cardly's support team to resolve the issue.\nHas the issue been resolved?\nAt the time of the last correspondence available in the reference material, there was an ongoing discussion regarding the resolution. The customer had requested assistance, and the support team was working on it. However, without further communication or updates, it cannot be definitively concluded whether the issue has been fully resolved. It's important to note that the summary is based solely on the information present in the reference materials, and there could potentially be developments beyond its scope.", "model": "NOW_LLM_llama13b_convclass_dpo_12723_pairwise_loss", "snapchosen": "The customers are concerned about two new employees having access to Cardly as administrators. They want these two employees granted the same level of access as another employee who set up their account has. The company does not want certain notifications sent to an old email anymore either.\nThey also mention stopping notifications for someone whose name isn't provided.\nOverall, there seems to be confusion regarding what access two newly added employees have in terms of the company's Cardly account and a desire to revoke access from a former employee whose name is omitted."}]
