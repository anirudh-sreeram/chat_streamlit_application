How much did she earn?\n\nSOLUTION\nWeng earns 12/60 = $<<12/60=0.2>>0.2 per minute.\nWorking 50 minutes, she earned 0.2 x 50 = $<<0.2*50=10>>10.\n#### 10\n\nExplain in detail how to solve the QUESTION above.

So let\u2019s divide 12 by 60 which gives us 0.2 dollars as our answer! Now we know that each minute Weng works will be worth 0.2 cents so if he worked for 50 minutes then it would have been 0.2 * 50 or 10 bucks altogether! \n\nSo the answer to your original question is that Weng made $10 yesterday from her job at the baby sitting center!", "rejected": "Here are the steps:\n\n1) Weng is paid $12 per hour which means that if we divide it by 60 (the number of minutes in one hour), then we get $12 / 60 = $0.2 per minute. So now we know that each minute she works, she gets paid $0.2. \n\n2) We need to find out how many minutes Weng worked yesterday so let's assume her working time was from 3 pm until 4 pm because there were only two hours between those times. And since we know that she does not work continuously but takes breaks as well, I will estimate that she spent about half an hour on break every day. That would mean that she actually worked for approximately 75 minutes. \n\nSo finally, after converting our estimated amount of time into actual minutes, here is what we have:\n$0.2 * 75 = $10\n\nTherefore, according to my calculations, Weng made $10 yesterday while doing babysitting!", "model": "NOW_LLM_15.5b_v0.5.0_103123_alltoken_loss"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me more"}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "Sure - I'd love to tell you more about solving math problems like this one.
