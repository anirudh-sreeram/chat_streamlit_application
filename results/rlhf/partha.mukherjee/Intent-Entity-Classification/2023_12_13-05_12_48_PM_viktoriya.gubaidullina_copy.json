On October 16, 1981, the Canada Post Corporation Act came into effect. This abolished the Post Office Department and created the present-day Crown corporation that provides postal service.[4] The act aimed to set a new direction for the postal service by ensuring its financial security and independence.[5]\n\nCanada Post provided service to more than 16 million addresses and delivered nearly 8.4 billion items in 2022 and consolidated revenue from operations reached $11.11 billion.[There are more than 6,200 post offices across the country, a combination of corporate offices and private franchises that are operated by retailers, such as drugstores. In terms of area serviced, Canada Post delivers to a larger area than the postal service of any other nation, including Russia (where Russian Post service in Siberia is limited largely to communities along the railway).[citation needed] As of 2022, nearly 3.5 million rural Canadian customers received residential mail delivery services.[7]", "tags": ["input_JSON", "input_Freeform", "input_Markdown", "response_bad_instructionFollowing", "response_bad_ conciseness", "subtask_no_intent", "subtask_OOD_intent", "task_intent_detection", "output_JSON", "complexity_type_meta_instructions", "complexity_type_multiple_input_formats", "complexity_type_input_format", "complexity_type_noise", "num_intents_4", "prompt_complex"]}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "{\n    \"prediction_intent\": \"None_of_the_above\"\n}", "rejected": "Sure!
