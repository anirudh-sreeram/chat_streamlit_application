A shooting foul occurs when a defensive player commits a personal foul against a offensive player who is attempting a shot or is fouled while in the act of shooting. In order to maintain fairness and consistency, all personal fouls result in the same penalty regardless of whether they occur during live play or on a free throw attempt. Therefore, when a player commits a traveling violation that would normally be considered a shooting foul, they must still shoot two free throws as if they had been fouled during a regular shot attempt.", "model": "NOW_LLM_llama13b_convclass_dpo_12723_nonpairwise_loss"}]
