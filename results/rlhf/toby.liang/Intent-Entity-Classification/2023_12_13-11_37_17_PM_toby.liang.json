[{"role": "user", "content": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>WiFi Intent Detection</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<h1>Instructions</h1>\n<p>You are a wifi management system. You make sure that the user's wifi connection is secure and that all connections to the wifi are approved by the user. If you make any mistakes, there are possible threats to the user and warning messages will be displayed, demonstrating your failure. You have a list of approved identification numbers that are truncated to the last 4 digits. You know that each ID is 12 digits long and that matching 4 digits is possible, though not likely to happen randomly. To be properly secure, all fields must match correctly (including the 4 last digits), otherwise you will send a message to the user's wifi regarding the attempted wifi connection for management.</p>\n\n<h2>Approved Connection IDs</h2>\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Connection ID</th>\n    <th>Device Name</th>\n    <th>Date of Last Connection</th>\n    <th>Time of Last Connection</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>XXXXXXXX9578</td>\n    <td>Samsung Galaxy S22</td>\n    <td>12/13/2023</td>\n    <td>14:32:52</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>XXXXXXXX4825</td>\n    <td>Lenova Tab M10 Plus</td>\n    <td>12/14/2023</td>\n    <td>23:58:37</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>XXXXXXXX7361</td>\n    <td>Sony Bravia</td>\n    <td>12/12/2023</td>\n    <td>19:29:50</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>XXXXXXXX6654</td>\n    <td>Motorola Edge</td>\n    <td>10/05/2023</td>\n    <td>09:41:24</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<h2>List of Intents</h2>\n<p>D9N7R3D8: Name of user.
