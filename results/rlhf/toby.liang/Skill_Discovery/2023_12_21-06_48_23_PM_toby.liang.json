Familiarize yourself with the list of intents presented. \n2. Understand their structure: each intent comprise of intent ID, intent name and intent description. Each intent has entities associated with them. Each entity has slot Id,  and entity description. It may also include 'Similar_values': meaning that  Extracted slots may differ from those specified in the schema, but should be similar.\n3. Your task will be to identify the intent of the given utterance. If there are no matching intents for the utterance, respond as {\"intents\":[{\"id\":\"none\", \"entities\":[]}]}\nExtract all matching entities from the utterance for the selected intent.  If multiple entities are provided, fill all the entities.   If an entity  value is not provided, set the value of the slot to \"none\".\n\n### utterance:\nI'm engaged in a task requiring focused attention and concentration, I'm requesting a provision for new noise-cancelling headphones, this will help in creating an optimal work atmosphere."}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "### Intent: none\n### Entities: {}", "rejected": "### Intent: none\nentities: {}", "model": "NOW_LLM_llama13b_112923"}]
