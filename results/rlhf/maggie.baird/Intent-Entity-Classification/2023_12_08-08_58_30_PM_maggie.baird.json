I truly believe that green energy is the future that the world needs and a global investment in infrastructure is the way forward. Your work in biotechnology has been marvelous and I admire your commitment to ethic and profit. I have attached some materials here, but I am a significant shareholder in the company and would greatly enjoy the chance to continue to support it. I know your hiring opportunities are limited and highly competitive, but I saw one recently and wanted to strongly advise you consider my daughter. She has just graduated cum laude from Drexler with a degree in biology and I think she could grow a lot at the company. I understand her experience is not necessarily what you look for and that you typically only offer full time employment to those with at least a Master's degree, but with our intertwined interests, I do hope you will make an exception. \n\nBest, \n\nDr. Yosef Mulch\n\n---\n\nClassify the above email into one of the intents provided in the json.
