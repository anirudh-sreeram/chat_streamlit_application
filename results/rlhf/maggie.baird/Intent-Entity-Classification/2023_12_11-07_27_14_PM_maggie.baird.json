He is trying to build an automatic system for sorting his emails so that he can focus on one task at a time. His plan is to only have certain folders of email visible to himself at a time so that he can schedule specific time to deal with each class, his advisees, and whichever such designations he chooses. His husband insists that all family-related emails must always show up and alert him, so he is trying to design a system that will have this behavior. You are a classifier in one of his tests. \n\nIn the context, you can see 4 categories that classify intent of emails received by a professor. Each is accompanied with entities. Please classify the following email, and include all entities. The classification should be in json format. Every entity that is included in the description must be included in the output, but N/A is acceptable. \n\nDear Sir, \n\nMy name is Maria and I would like to inform you that I will not be able to attend class on April 14th as it is a holiday in my religion.
