The json is a dictionary of dictionaries. The keys are intent IDs and values include a description and a dictionary of attributes. Each attribute has an ID and slot description. Some attributes contain required values, meaning the slot can only be filled by items in the provided list. You will be given a message and asked to output its intent and corresponding entities. If no intents match, output an empty json dictionary {}. If an entity value is not able to be extracted, do not include any reference to that attribute in the output. Your output should be a dictionary of dictionaries with keys of intent IDs and values of attribute dictionaries with IDs and extracted values. Only include matching intents.

I know that the company uses lots of different applications and I'm so used to my personal computer that I'm having trouble adjusting. I can't even find anything on the website about how to get the Drive app or set up an account. Please tell me what I'm supposed to do because I know I'm supposed to use this for work and my manager said everything was good to go and it's just my own fault I can't find the right place to go.
