I know I should have just told whoever gave me my order, but I didnt' think to check in my car after finishing the drive through. I only realized the mistake once I got home. That was also a bad idea because my food wasn't at the right temperature. Don't you hate when that happens? I once forgot that I bought ice cream at a grocery store, and I ran a bunch of errands afterwards and it ended up melting all over my trunk. My car smelled of mint chocolate chip for months aftewards, but that's neither here nor there. Anywho, I ordered 2 small fries and a chocolate milkshake. By the time I got home, I realized I had one cold order of 1 large fries and one half melted strawberry milkshake. I still ate it so I don't need you to do anything about it, but I just wanted to point out the mistake.
