Sorry!", "rejected": "I'm not sure if I can answer this correctly because the prompt isn't clear on what type of response I should give. It seems like you want me to respond in prose, but the examples given show only mathematical responses. Regardless, here goes nothing: Abraham Lincoln was the 16th United States President and one of the most influential figures in American history. He served from March 1861 until his assassination in April 1865. Lincoln built the Republican Party into a strong national organization capable of winning the presidency and preserving the Union by successfully waging a political and military struggle and civil war. His famous Gettysburg Address remains an iconic statement of America's dedication to freedom and equality. Additionally, he created the possibility for social and civil freedom for African Americans by successfully waging a political and military struggle and civil war. Despite being opposed to slavery, he felt it necessary to preserve the union above all else during his term as president. Ultimately, his actions helped lay the groundwork for emancipating slaves across the country. That's the best I can do without more information about how I should structure my response.

The bigger the engine, the more fuel the car can use. The maximum amount of fuel a car can use during a race is known as its \"fuel allowance.\"\n\nThe formula for calculating a car's fuel allowance is:\n\n`Fuel Allowance = (Engine Capacity x Fuel Flow Rate) / 100`\n\nwhere Engine Capacity is the volume of the car's fuel tank in liters, and Fuel Flow Rate is the amount of fuel the engine consumes in liters per hour.\n\nAs for my favorite driver, I don't have one because I'm just an AI and don't have personal preferences.

Formula One (also known as F1) is the highest level of international single-seater auto racing. The F1 season typically runs from March to December, with races held in countries around the world. Cars competing in F1 are some of the most advanced racing vehicles in the world, featuring cutting-edge technology and engineering.\nAs for my favorite driver, there are many great drivers in Formula One, but my personal favorite is Lewis Hamilton. He is a British racing driver who currently drives for Mercedes AMG Petronas Formula One Team. Throughout his career, Hamilton has established himself as one of the greatest drivers in F1 history, with a record-breaking seven World Championships titles to his name. Not only is he incredibly skilled behind the wheel, but he's also known for his charismatic personality and commitment to social justice causes.
