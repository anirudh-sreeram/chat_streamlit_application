Trust me, those mountains and prairies can get kind of repetitive.\n\nFinally, remember that this is a long trip, so don't burn your bridges with your parents on the first day. Act like you're into it at first, and then gradually fade into your own world. They'll get the hint and leave you alone after a while.\n\nHang in there, buddy!
