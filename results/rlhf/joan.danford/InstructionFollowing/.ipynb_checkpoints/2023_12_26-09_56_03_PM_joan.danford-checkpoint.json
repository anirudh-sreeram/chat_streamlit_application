[{"role": "context", "content": "Your friend approaches you and asks if you can help her plan some of the details of her upcoming wedding.  She knows you have worked in the event and hospitality industry before and have done your fair share of wedding planning. She asks for help deciding on how to handle the food and drinks at the reception, how to handle the seating arrangements, and how to handle the timeline of the wedding day overall. \n\nYou decide the food will be catered as a buffet, there will be an open bar for the majority of the reception, and also wine on the tables during dinner service. You also adopt a fairly informal seating arrangement, allowing guests to mingle regardless of whether they are acquaintances of the bride or of the groom. \n\nYou work together and decide on the following for a timeline:\n\nWedding: 2:00 PM\n\nWedding Photos (Bride and Groom and immediate family): 2:30 or immediately following the wedding\n\nReception begins: 2:30 PM\n\nOpen Bar/Cocktail Hour starts: 2:30 PM\n\nArrival of Bride and Groom: 3:30 PM\n\nCocktail Hour Ends: 4:00 PM\n\nGuests are seated for dinner: 4:00 PM\n\nBride and Groom Share a first dance: 4:05 PM\n\nBuffet opens, with guests being called to line by table number: 4:15 PM\n\nChampagne Served for Toasts: 5:00 PM\n\nCake Cutting: 5:30\n\nBouquet and Garter Tosses (one after the other): 6:00 PM\n\nDancing until reception closes: 6:10 to end\n\nBar closes: 8:30 PM\n\nBride and Groom Send-off and Exit (and reception ends): 9:00 PM\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I've been invited to my friend's wedding, but I have to run an errand about 20 minutes away before I can go to the reception.
