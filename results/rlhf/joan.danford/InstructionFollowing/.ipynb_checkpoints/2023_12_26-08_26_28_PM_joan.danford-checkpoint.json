Depending on when the book was published and if it's going to be used in the subsequent semester, you could earn anywhere from 30-50 percent of the original price. The exact amount depends on several factors, but the seasoned used book in fair condition should yield an appropriate sum. Of course, there are other factors like the current supply of the book and its demand, which may vary per term. So, while the precise payout isn't precisely quantifiable, rest assured that the general range provided should hold true. \n\nKnow that our prices are competitive, and you'll likely walk away with a decent amount\u2014more so than exchanging it at a different shop where you might get even less. Plus, our system offers flexibility based on the book's longevity; newer texts tend to fetch higher resale values. So, sit tight until the end of the semester, and you'll likely benefit from a favorable buyback offer!", "rejected": "Yes, once the semester ends, you can return your textbook to us for a buyback. We typically offer 50% of the original price if the book will be used in the subsequent semester, which aligns with your situation since you're taking a Psychology class. So, assuming the book is in decent shape, you could potentially receive $60 for it. Of course, the final buyback price will depend on several factors like the actual demand for the book and how many other students decide to sell their copies back. But based on our usual rates, you can estimate receiving $60. Keep in mind that these rates are subject to change, and we'll notify you of the precise amount during the buyback event.
