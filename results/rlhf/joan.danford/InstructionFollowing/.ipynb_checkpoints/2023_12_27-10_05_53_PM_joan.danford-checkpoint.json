It's not cool to go on a lame family vacation, but it's also not cool to be the only one who doesn't go, right? Here's some advice from someone who's been in your shoes before: try to convince your parents that you need to stay home to study or hang out with your friends. If that doesn't work, see if your siblings can't swap trips with you. Maybe they have something else planned that they'd rather do, and you can go do that instead.
