{"conversation": [{"role": "context", "content": "You are a new resident of the Tampa Bay area in Florida, and you've heard about this big Gasparilla pirate festival that takes place there every year.  You want to go to the main event, the invasion and day parade of pirates held at the end of January, but you're not sure of how to get there and where to park, since you've also heard that a lot of the streets are closed for the parade and parking is only in certain areas.  \n\nYou do your research and find that you really want to be at the convention center for part of the day so that you can see the boat parade approach, leading the pirate ship and the invasion, then you want to make your way to Curtis Hixon Park to see the land parade and then stay for the concerts and other festivities.  \n\nYou decide to park in a parking garage in on 8th street and Nuccio in Ybor City, then take the trolley to the convention center.  The closest trolley stop is 2 blocks away. \n\nFrom the Convention Center, Curtis Hixon Park is about a mile North. You can take the trolley most of the way between the two, but you'll still need to walk about .25 miles. The trolley runs every ten minutes, but you still may have to wait for several passes, given the size of the crowd and the demand on parade day.\n\nYou parked about 2 miles East of Curtis Hixon.  The trolley runs round trips, but the closest stop is still about .25 miles south of Curtix Hixon. \n\nThe boat invasion takes place around noon, arriving at the Convention Center. The land parade route itself is 4.5 miles long, starts at 2 pm and ends when it reaches Curtis Hixon Park, around 2:30. \n\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I'm going to Gasparilla!
