You do not buy back textbooks that are not slated for use in the next immediate semester. \n-For literature books (usually paperbacks) that will be used in an upcoming semester, you generally buy them back at 50% flat rate off of the \"new\" price, but only if they are in good condition\n\nWhen selling used books:\n-Textbooks are sold at 60% of what the \"new\" price would be\n-Literature books are sold at 75% of their original \"new\" price\n\nFor popular fiction: \n-you only accept popular fiction (those books not affiliated with any college course) and nonfiction on a consignment basis.
