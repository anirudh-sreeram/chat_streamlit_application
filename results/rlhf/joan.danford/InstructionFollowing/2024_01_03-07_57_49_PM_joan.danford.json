Some of the things you could talk about include:\n\n1. Everybody Likes Chocolate, so you can safely have it any day of the week with your family, your friends, or just share it with a neighbor or old friend while you catch up over coffee. \n2. Chocolate Cake is a Comfort Food, and we don't need a special occasion to indulge in comfort food, do we?\n3. It Helps Relieve Stress, and anything that can help relieve stress in this stressful day-to-day life can't possibly be a bad thing!\n4. It Has Many Varieties, so you can try a different kind of chocolate cake every day and never get bored. \n5.
