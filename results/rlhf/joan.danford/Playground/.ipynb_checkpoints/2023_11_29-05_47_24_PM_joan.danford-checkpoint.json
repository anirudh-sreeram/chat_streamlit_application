Her presence on the mission generated considerable public interest and made it a major story in the news leading up to the launch.\n\n- The launch itself occurred at a time when live television coverage of space missions was relatively new and still novel. The ability to watch a rocket take off live from Earth had only been possible since the early days of the space race with the Soviet Union. As a result, many people were tuned in to witness the liftoff of the Challenger, which made the disaster all the more shocking because it happened in front of millions of viewers.\n\n- The explosion of the Challenger just minutes after liftoff was captured on live television, and images of the breaking apart of the spacecraft and its debris falling into the Atlantic Ocean were seen around the world. It was one of the first major news events to be broadcast live globally.\n\n- The death of all seven astronauts aboard the Challenger, including Christa McAuliffe, was a profound tragedy that shook the nation and led to widespread coverage of the accident and its aftermath. The disaster prompted a national discussion about the risks of space travel and the future of the space shuttle program.\n\nIn short, the Challenger launch of January 28, 1986, was a major media event before and after the explosion because of the historic nature of the mission, the presence of a civilian passenger, and the global impact of watching the disaster unfold live on television.<|end", "rejected": "The Challenger space shuttle mission was launched on January 28, 1986.
