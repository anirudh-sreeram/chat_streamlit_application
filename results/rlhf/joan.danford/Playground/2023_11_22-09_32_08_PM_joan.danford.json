Here are some popular themes that couples have chosen:\n\n1. Rustic chic - This theme is perfect for outdoor venues, with lots of wooden elements and natural textures like burlap and lace. You can incorporate vintage pieces into your decor to add character.\n\n2. Nautical - If you're both sailors or love the ocean, this could be an ideal choice. Use rope, anchors, and nautical flags as part of your decoration. Consider having a boat ride during cocktail hour or serving seafood-themed dishes at dinner.\n\n3. Garden party - A garden party theme works well in springtime when flowers are in full bloom. Think pastel colors, floral arrangements, and lawn games such as croquet and badminton.\n\n4. Vineyard - For wine lovers, consider hosting your event at a local winery or vineyard. Incorporate bottles of wine into your d\u00e9cor alongside other rustic elements such as barrels and crates. Serve small bites featuring cheeses, charcuterie boards, and fresh fruit paired with different types of wine.\n\n5. Winter wonderland - Embrace the holiday season by choosing a winter wonderland theme. Decorate with pine cones, garlands, and twinkling lights. Offer hot chocolate and warm drinks throughout the evening.", "rejected": "Sure! Here are some ideas:\n\n1. A beach-themed wedding with sand, sea shells, and starfish decorations.

An elegant black tie affair with formal attire for both the bride and groom, as well as their guests. The ceremony might involve candlelight and classical music while the reception features live jazz music and hors d'oeuvres served on silver trays.\n\n3. A rustic country wedding with hay bales, mason jar centerpieces, and homemade desserts. The ceremony may be held outdoors amongst trees and flowers while the reception takes place inside a barn or other large building where guests can enjoy traditional country fare like barbecue ribs and hot dogs.\n\n4. A vintage-inspired event featuring antique furniture, lace tablecloths, and retro cocktails.
