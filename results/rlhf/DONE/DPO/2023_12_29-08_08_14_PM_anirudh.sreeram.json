This process may take 30 to 90 calendar days to complete.\n\nWhat is the reason for the 30-90 day duration of the process?\n\nAs your card isn't linked to a savings, checking, or credit account, this product is not governed by the same regulations as these conventional services. Nonetheless, we make every effort to help you reach a resolution as swiftly as possible. The majority of our disputes are typically resolved within 30 calendar days.\n\nNecessary Reminders\n\n    You will be kept informed of each phase of the investigation, including the final decision, via email to an e-mail address you have provided.\n    After the dispute investigation is finished, if it is determined that an error has taken place, the funds will be issued to your account or card. Conversely, if our investigation does not reveal an error, your account will not receive a refund, and you will receive a final decision via e-mail.\n    If an error is found, any fees associated with your disputed transaction(s)  will be credited as soon as your dispute is resolved.\n    If no e-mail address has been provided, you will be informed via physical mail.\n   In the event that funds are refunded, they will be immediately accessible to use on your active card. If a replacement card is needed yet it hasn't been issued to you, it will be mailed upon resolution.  It may take 7-10 calendar days.\n\nShould you have any inquiries or require assistance regarding your dispute case, please reply to this e-mail, which will be linked to your dispute case, and we will respond within 10 business days.
