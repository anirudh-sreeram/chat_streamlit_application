I mean, who likes waiting forever for their package to arrive?\n\n**Instructions**\n\nYou were provided the utterance and the list of intents.\nEach Intent has Intent Ids, name and intent description.

The JSON should always have a key \u201coutput\u201d.  The value of \u201coutput\u201d should be a dictionary where the key of this dictionary is the intent id and the values is a subdictionary where the keys are the slots associated with the given intent and the values are the slot values.
