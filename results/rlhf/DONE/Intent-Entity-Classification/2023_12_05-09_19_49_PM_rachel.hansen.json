This is a routine appointment which is typically done twice a year to avoid cavities. The dentist will also perform an inspection for any cavities or issues to be fixed at a later date. \nYellow: Having a cavity filled by a dentist. This includes numbing teeth. \nGreen: A tooth that needs to be removed from the mouth. \nPink: Taking care of the health of the gums - the dental hygienist will check the gums for inflammation and general health. \nBlue: None of the intents above are applicable.\n\nSTATEMENT\n------------------\nMy tooth is in a lot of pain.
