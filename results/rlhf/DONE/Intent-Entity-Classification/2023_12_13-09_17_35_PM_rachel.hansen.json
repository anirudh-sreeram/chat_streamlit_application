Not because I had perfect teeth, but more because my family didn't have the money or the insurance to have braces. Now I'm in my thirties and I am finally starting the process of getting braces because my teeth are so crooked, I feel like I'm a british person in the 18th century. \n\n-------\n\n##Important Information About Teeth\n\nIncisors (from Latin incidere, \"to cut\") are the front teeth present in most mammals. They are located in the premaxilla above and on the mandible below. Humans have a total of eight (two on each side, top and bottom). Among other animals, the number varies from species to species. Opossums have 18, whereas armadillos have none. Cats, dogs, foxes, pigs, and horses have twelve. Rodents have four. Rabbits and hares (lagomorphs) were once considered rodents, but are distinguished by having six\u2014one small pair, called \"peg teeth\", is located directly behind the most anterior pair. Incisors are used to bite off tough foods, such as red meat.\n\nCattle (cows, bulls, etc.) have none on top but a total of six on the bottom.\n\nIn cats, the incisors are small; biting off meat is done with the canines and the carnassials. In elephants, the upper incisors are modified into curved tusks (unlike with Narwhals, where it is a canine that develops into a straight and twisted tusk).[3] The incisors of rodents grow throughout life and are worn by gnawing. In humans, the incisors serve to cut off pieces of food, as well as in the grip of other food items.", "tags": ["task_entity_extraction", "prompt_complex", "subtask_no_entity", "response_bad_incorrect", "response_bad_instructionFollowing", "input_YAML", "input_Lists", "input_Markdown", "output_YAML", "complexity_type_noise", "complexity_type_including_examples", "complexity_type_input_format"]}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "Baby Teeth: None\nAdult Teeth: None\nWisdom Teeth: None\nBones: None\n", "rejected": "##Slot Fillings\n\nHere is the extracted data using the formatting instructions requested:\n\nSlotID: Baby Teeth\n    - Incisor\n    - Molar\n\nSlotID: Adult Teeth\n    - None\n\nSlotID: Wisdom Teeth\n    - None\n\nSlotID: Bones\n    - None", "model": "NOW_LLM_llama13b_convclass_dpo_12723_nonpairwise_loss"}]
