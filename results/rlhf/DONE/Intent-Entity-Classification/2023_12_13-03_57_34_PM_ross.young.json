First, could you please provide me with your account number? It should be a ten-digit number located on your billing statement.\n**Customer:** Okay, I have it in front of me. The number is 3248487733.\n**Agent:** Great, thank you so much for providing that information. Now, let me confirm your identity. Could you please tell me your full name and date of birth? This will ensure that we are speaking with the correct person about your account.\n**Customer:** Sure, my name is Padla Matay, and my date of birth is June 13, 1984.\n**Agent:** Thank you again for your cooperation. With this information, I am able to verify that we are indeed discussing your account. At this point, I can proceed with linking your new phone to your existing plan.
