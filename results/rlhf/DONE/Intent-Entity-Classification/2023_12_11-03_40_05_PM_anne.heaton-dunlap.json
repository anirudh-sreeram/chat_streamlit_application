The Apollo 11 mission to the moon had four on-board computers. One guidance computer in the Apollo capsule itself, a second, redundant one, in the lunar lander, a specialized thrust management computer on the Saturn V booster, and an emergency abort computer on the lunar lander which could get the lander back into orbit and docked with the orbiting Apollo capsule in the event the main lander computer failed. In parallel with these systems, there was actually a fully manual flight control system on both the capsule and the lunar lander, so in the event of a complete computer failure the astronauts could manually pilot the vehicle back to earth.\n\n 2. In 339 BC, after a long and contentious trial, a jury of 500 Athenians voted 280 to 220 to put the philosopher Socrates to death. He had been accused of impiety, which is to say failing to respect the appropriate gods of the city of Athens, and corrupting the young, which is a bit vaguer but seems to have largely involved the political implications of his philosophical ideas. According to most accounts, Socrates\u2019s actual death was delayed by a couple of weeks, during which he had the opportunity to flee the city, but he opted instead to stay and accept his punishment, ultimately ending his life by drinking hemlock tea.\n\n3. I didn\u2019t manage to get an essay out last week; I was in Japan for most of the work week and I had a hard time motivating myself to bang out an essay on Veteran\u2019s day given how jet lagged I was and how basically behind I felt on other stuff. Since I\u2019m sure people are curious, the Japan trip was good and worth doing. I met maybe a half dozen customers, did a marketing event, and did a couple of internal meetings with folks both on my team and on the broader ServiceNow team working there.\n\n4. Imagine, if you will, that you\u2019re the US government, and its 1973. Opec has just imposed an oil embargo on the US, and its caused the price of oil, and more importantly gasoline, to skyrocket domestically. There are lines in front of gas stations, and even for those consumers lucky enough to work their way to the front of the queue, the price of filling up their cars has shot up. In the grand scheme of life, such a disruption ranks below a major war, or a natural disaster, but in a nation accustomed to more or less relentless economic progress since the second world war, this gas crisis quickly became a political crisis; the US government felt it had to do something.\n\n5. The whole call last night though got me thinking about time zones, and how they interact with computers, software, and our life. If you\u2019re reading this essay, I\u2019d be stunned if you didn\u2019t have a pretty solid intuitive understanding of how time zones work, and the problem they try to solve, but I do think its worth spelling it out the history of these things with a little formality. If nothing else, it\u2019ll give an interesting perspective on why the world\u2019s timezone system seems like (to me at least) such a mess.\n \n6. I spent a decent amount of time this week discussing, and reviewing, the accuracy of various large language models.  The unsurprising context here is that we have a variety of features in our product that are either shipping now, or due to ship this year, that rely on underlying LLMs to do things like summarize text, or answer a question in plain English. Perhaps similarly unsurprisingly, there are a variety of potential LLMs we can choose to use to do things with. For summarizing a task, for example, we could use openAI 3.5, openAI 4.0, Llama, Nemo, or our own internal Starcoder model, just to name a few.\n\n\n", "tags": ["response_bad_formatError", "response_bad_incorrect", "output_JSON", "input_JSON", "input_Freeform", "num_intents_6", "subtask_multi_intent", "complexity_type_adding_conditionals", "complexity_type_input_format", "complexity_type_meta_instructions", "complexity_type_noise", "complexity_type_including_examples", "prompt_complex"]}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "{\n    \"Matches\": {\n        \"Ancient Greece\": \"2\",\n        \"Computers in Space\": \"1\",\n        \"Time Zones\": \"5\",\n        \"Language Models\": \"6\",\n        \"Managing Oil\": \"4\",\n        \"Business Travel\": \"3\"\n    }\n}", "rejected": "{\n    \"Matches\": [\n        \"Ancient Greece\": \"3.\",\n        \"Computers in Space\": \"1.\",\n        \"Time Zones\": \"5.\",\n        \"Language Models\": \"6.\",\n        \"Managing Oil\": \"4.\"\n    ]\n}", "model": "NOW_LLM_llama13b_convclass_dpo_pairwise_loss"}]
