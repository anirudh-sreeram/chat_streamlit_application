First, you should read the above table to become familiar with a subset of typical banking transactions defined by reading the descriptions associated with each.  Each transaction also has an example provided that specifies a viable utterance that would be classified into that given intent class.  Each intent will also have a unique ID associated with it that starts with an upper case letter, 3 numbers, and 2 lower case letters. \n\nFor each transaction type there are also slots associated with them. Slots are values that need to be retrieved for a particular transaction. Each slot will have a name and an example of what a value looks like. If multiple slots are provided, fill all the slots. If a slot is not provided, set the value of the slot to N/A. \n\nBelow is an utterance.  You should read the entirety of the utterance and determine which transaction type would best match the user\u2019s request.  If there are multiple transactions that would match the utterance equally well, make sure to output all. For each chosen transaction, extract the slots and their values if present and set the slot value to N/A if it is not present. \n\nGive your final output as a JSON.  The JSON should always have a key \u201coutput\u201d.  The value of \u201coutput\u201d should be a dictionary where the key of this dictionary is the transaction id and the values is a subdictionary where the keys are the slot ids associated with the given transaction and the values are the slot values.  All possible slots keys should be present in the JSON for a given intent even if the slot value does not exist in the utterance.\n\nUTTERANCE \nI need to pay a bill in the amount of $27.48 to Hydro Quebec. It should be taken from my savings account ending in 3134. I also have a recurring monthly transaction with Netflix in the amount of $9.99 that occurs on the 15th that I need to cancel.
