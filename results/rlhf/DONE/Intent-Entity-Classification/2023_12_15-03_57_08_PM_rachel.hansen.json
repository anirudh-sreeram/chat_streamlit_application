Informal methods of using shared files to pass messages were soon expanded into the first mail systems. Most developers of early mainframes and minicomputers developed similar, but generally incompatible, mail applications. Over time, a complex web of gateways and routing systems linked many of them. Some systems also supported a form of instant messaging, where sender and receiver needed to be online simultaneously.\",\n    \"Utterance\": \"Yesterday I was trying to send emails about my upcoming meeting about improvements to the Oakland City Community Center, but when I called my contact there, they said they never received any of those emails.

The user reports that yesterday they were unable to determine whether some important emails had been sent, so they reached out for help right away. Today, they cannot even access their email at all.
