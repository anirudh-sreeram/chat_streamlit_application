As well, you need to pass along specific details, as outlined above, if present, to the agent so they don't have to ask the user additional questions.\n\nAny categories determined to apply, along with the associated entities, need to be formatted in json for the agent to consume.\n\nHere is the request from a user:\n\n\"In the ESPP policy it states that: With a qualified Section 423 ESPP (U.S. participants), you are not taxed at the time the shares are purchased, only when you sell. Depending on whether the shares were held for the required holding period, a portion of your gain may be taxed as capital gains or as ordinary income. The holding period for ESPP is two years from grant date (the first day of the Offering Period) AND one year from purchase date. If you do not meet the holding period for these shares, ServiceNow is required to report additional income for you to the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nI want to decrease my deductions from my commissions to 10% , and from my base salary to 5%.\n\nI also need clarification on when I can sell based on this information I found: All employees are subject to the trading windows. You may only trade in ServiceNow stock during an open trading window, unless pursuant to a 10b5-1 plan. The trading windows open on the second business day following the Company's earnings release and close on the last day of the second month of the quarter. Generally, this means the trading windows are open in the months of February, May, August, and November.\n\nThanks again for any help you can give me.\n\n", "tags": ["input_Freeform", "output_JSON", "prompt_complex", "Task_combination", "subtask_multi_entity", "subtask_multi_intent", "complexity_type_noise", "complexity_type_meta_instructions", "num_intents_6", "complexity_type_including_examples", "complexity_type_multiple_input_formats"]}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "{\n    \"espp_4\": {\n        \"deduction_percentage\": [\n            \"10%\",\n            \"5%\"\n        ],\n        \"compensation_type\": [\n            \"commissions\",\n            \"base salary\"\n        ]\n    },\n\"espp_2\"\n}", "rejected": "{\n    \"espp_4\": {\n        \"payroll_deduction\": [\n            \"base salary\",\n            \"commissions\"\n        ],\n        \"number_of_shares\": \"0\",\n        \"company_stock\": \"ServiceNow\"\n    }\n}", "model": "NOW_LLM_llama13b_1115_dpo_nonpairwise_loss_with_scale27k", "snapchosen": "{\n    \"espp_4\": {\n        \"deduction_percentage\": [\n            \"10%\",\n            \"5%\"\n        ],\n        \"compensation_type\": [\n            \"commissions\",\n            \"base salary\"\n        ]\n    },\n\"espp_2\"\n}"}]
