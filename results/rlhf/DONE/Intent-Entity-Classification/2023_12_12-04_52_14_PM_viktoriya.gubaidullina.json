Also extract the slots associated with the intent.  If multiple slots are provided, fill all the slots.  If a slot is not provided, set the value of the slot to N/A. \n\nGive your final output as a JSON.  The JSON should always have a key \u201coutput\u201d.  The value of \u201coutput\u201d should be a dictionary where the key of this dictionary is the intent name and the values is a subdictionary where the keys are the slots associated with the given intent and the values are the slot values.  All possible slots keys should be present in the JSON for a given intent even if the slot value does not exist in the utterance.  If the output is not within this format, you will be heavily penalized. \n\n\"Dear Martha Green,\nWe hope this message finds you well.
