[{"role": "user", "content": "##About You\nYou monitor chats on a internet company's website for issues related to wifi. From the initial message(s) you search automatically for what the user needs assistance with. Then you mark the chat with that intent ID and it moves to those department's agents for further action. You cannot make any mistakes or the user will be sent to the wrong department and it will take longer for their problem to be solved and you will receive a negative review from them. If you do it correctly, you will receive a positive or neutral review. When you have 100 positive reviews, you will get a raise. \n\n##Intents You Can Detect\nLWET236: the user wants their device to forget the wifi connection. This means that their device will no longer automatically connect whenever it comes within range of that wifi. \nBJKN34T9DFJK: the user wants to disconnect all users from their home wifi connection. \nKJXNBIEU3T9: the user wants to reset the password for their home wifi. The user cannot change the password for a wifi they do not manage. \nKDFHVUY439: the user wants to change the name of their home wifi. The user cannot change the name for a wifi they do not manage. \nIUENKJ4578OYDJFK: the user wants to troubleshoot why their home wifi isn't working properly. \nKJWEHRIUTT349: the user wants to change their wifi plan. \nKLCN4309: the user wants to cancel their wifi plan.\nIUBEWRJK4596: No intent was identified. \n\n#Instructions\nDetect all intents within the utterance. Your identification should be formatted like a YAML with Lemon/Orange as the values. Orange means it was found within the utterance and Lemon means it was not found within the utterance. You must also identify the user's sentiment (negative, neutral, positive) with \"sentiment\" as the key and the sentiment as the value. \n\n#Example\nInput: \nHow do I update my wifi name from \"XSR489\" to \"Pickles77\"\n\nOutput:\n-LWET236: Lemon\n-BJKN34T9DFJK: Lemon\n-KJXNBIEU3T9: Lemon\n-KDFHVUY439: Orange\n-IUENKJ4578OYDJFK: Lemon\n-KJWEHRIUTT349: Lemon\n-KLCN4309: Lemon\n-IUBEWRJK4596: Lemon\n-Sentiment: neutral\n\n#Utterance\nBot: Hello! How can I help you today? \nCustomer: I keep getting kicked off the wifi while I'm trying to work. I'm getting a notification that says \"Low Network Connection\" - I'm not sure what the issue is, my phone is connected with no problems. This is very frustrating as I have to be in zoom meetings all day and I cannot be constantly kicked off my own internet. \n\n", "tags": ["output_YAML", "task_intent_detection", "subtask_single_intent", "input_Markdown", "input_Freeform", "input_Lists", "num_intents_8", "complexity_type_adding_conditionals", "complexity_type_meta_instructions", "complexity_type_multiple_subtasks", "complexity_type_including_examples", "response_bad_incomplete", "response_bad_irrelevantInformation", "response_bad_instructionFollowing", "response_bad_ conciseness", "prompt_complex"]}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "-LWET236: Lemon\n-BJKN34T9DFJK: Lemon\n-KJXNBIEU3T9: Lemon\n-KDFHVUY439: Lemon\n-IUENKJ4578OYDJFK: Orange\n-KJWEHRIUTT349: Lemon\n-KLCN4309: Lemon\n-IUBEWRJK4596: Lemon\n-Sentiment: Negative", "rejected": "-IUENKJ4578OYDJFK: Orange\n-KJWEHRIUTT349: Lemon\n-KLCN4309: Lemon\n-IUBEWRJK4596: Lemon\n-Sentiment: negative\n\nThe customer has an issue with their wifi connection which could mean several things including their password being incorrect, their network settings needing adjustment, or there may even be a fault with their router.
