Before and after the file make a border with \"+-+-\" repeating.\n\nShort story:\n\"In the bustling city of New York, there was a small coffee shop called \"Joe's Cup O' Joe\". The owner, an elderly man named Joseph, had recently hired a new barista to help out during the busy morning rush. Her name was Jane, and she quickly became popular with the regulars for her friendly demeanor and excellent coffee art.\n\nOne day, while Jane was busy making lattes and cappuccinos, a mysterious stranger entered the shop. He was tall and broad-shouldered, with a confident stride that commanded attention. His name was Alexander, but everyone called him Xander. He approached Jane and ordered his usual drink, a double espresso. As he waited for his order, he struck up a conversation with Jane, asking about her background and how she ended up in New York working at a coffee shop.\n\nAs it turned out, Jane had always been passionate about coffee and had traveled the world in search of the perfect bean. She finally settled in New York after meeting a fellow coffee enthusiast who owned Joe's Cup O' Joe. Jane couldn't resist the opportunity to work alongside someone who shared her love for coffee, so she applied for the job and never looked back.\n\nXander was intrigued by Jane's story and asked if he could buy her a cup of coffee. She politely declined, explaining that customers weren't allowed to receive free drinks from the baristas. However, Xander insisted on paying for his own beverage, and the two of them chatted over their coffees for the rest of the morning.\"", "tags": ["task_entity_extraction", "response_bad_irrelevantInformation", "input_Freeform", "subtask_single_entity", "output_JSON", "prompt_complex", "complexity_type_meta_instructions", "output_Custom", "response_bad_instructionFollowing", "response_bad_incorrect"]}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-\n[\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Xander\"\n    }\n] \n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-\n", "rejected": "+-+-+\n[\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Joseph\",\n        \"role\": \"owner\"\n    }\n]\n+-+-+\n[\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Jane\",\n        \"role\": \"barista\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Alexander\",\n        \"role\": \"mysterious stranger\"\n    }\n]\n+-+-+\n{}", "model": "NOW_LLM_llama13b_convclass_dpo_12723_nonpairwise_loss"}]
