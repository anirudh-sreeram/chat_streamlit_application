[{"role": "context", "content": "A growing body of scientific evidence indicates that wholesome vegetarian diets offer distinct advantages compared to diets containing meat and other foods of animal origin. The benefits arise from lower intakes of saturated fat, cholesterol and animal protein as well as higher intakes of complex carbohydrates, dietary fiber, magnesium, folic acid, vitamin C and E, carotenoids and other phytochemicals. Since vegetarians consume widely divergent diets, a differentiation between various types of vegetarian diets is necessary. Indeed, many contradictions and misunderstandings concerning vegetarianism are due to scientific data from studies without this differentiation. In the past, vegetarian diets have been described as being deficient in several nutrients including protein, iron, zinc, calcium, vitamin B12 and A, n-3 fatty acids and iodine. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the observed deficiencies are usually due to poor meal planning. \n\n5-Ingredient Meals:\nTN879 (Rice, tuna, cheese, frozen vegetables, cream of chicken soup)\nBF315 (Broccoli, beef, bell pepper, beef stock, soy sauce)\nCP999 (Chickpeas, tomatoes, moroccan spices, zucchini, yogurt)\nZC156 (Zucchini, potatoes, cheese, eggs, flour)\nCH287 (Potatoes, cheese, sour cream, cream of chicken soup, garlic salt)\nPK318 (Pork chops, salsa, cilantro, corn, bell pepper)\nAP265 (Apples, walnuts, onion, yogurt, curry)\nSH469 (Linguine, shrimp, cream cheese, broccoli, tomatoes)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Items such as meat, fish and dairy, as well as nuts and legumes contain differing levels of protein.
