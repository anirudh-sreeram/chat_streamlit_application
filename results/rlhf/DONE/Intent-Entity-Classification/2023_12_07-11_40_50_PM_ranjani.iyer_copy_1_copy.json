[{"role": "user", "content": "Disney World Review\n\nMy day at Disneyland was fairly normal. Nothing out of the ordinary happened. I spent a lot of time looking for parking because I got there pretty late in the day. I did not get to ride on the new Rise of the Resistance or Space Mountain because the lines were too long, but I did get to do the madhatter teacups. I ate pizza and I'm pretty sure I had pasta at the place from Lady and Tramp. I spent a lot of time with Pooh, and Eeyore, and I really liked doing the Hollywood Studio tour stuff. But my favorite part of the day was seeing the different cultures at Epcot. I guess when I write it all out, the normal day is pretty extraordinary.\n\nOkay, using the activities and their descriptions, I want to know which intents match the above review of a trip to Disney World. If there are multiple tags that can be associated with a review, list all of them and any entities that can be identified by their possible values , and the order they are presented in does not matter. The possible values for the entities are limited to the given list, but you should account for typos or slight variations in how the objects are referenced. The output should be in json format with each intent as a name, with a value such where the entity id is a name and the possible values are an array. If an activity does not correlate with any of the provided entities, do not select that intent.\n\nDisney World activities:\n\nIntent 1- ID: na101: None of the following activities can be categorized\n\nIntent 2- ID: sf456: Disney World offers a variety of foods for guests to sample, including several Mickey-shaped foods.\n###Entity ID: MF456\n###MF456 values: Mickey ice cream, Dole Whip, Churros, Mickey Pretzel, Mickey Beignets, Crispy Mac and Cheese Bites, Mickey Waffles, Caramel Popcorn\n\nIntent 3- ID: mgc123: Guests can meet and take pictures with Disney characters at Disney World.\n###Entity ID: CRC123\n###CRC123 values: Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Daisy Duck, Goofy, Pluto, Cinderella, Snow White, Mulan, Jasmine, Tiana\n\nIntent 4-ID: tnr789: Riders can try out new rides at Disney World if they are seeking thrills, want to engage in typical theme park activities, or want to experience Disney in new way.\n###Entity ID: DWR789\n###DWR789 values: Space Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, It's a Small World, Star Wars Rise of the Resistance, Expedition Everest, Spaceship Earth, Kilimanjaro Safari\n\nIntent 5- ID: wp101: Guests can watch parades at Disney World, featuring Disney characters and floats, fun music, and seasonal variations.\n", "tags": ["output_JSON", "input_Custom", "task_combination", "num_intents_5", "subtask_NA_intent", "subtask_no_intent", "subtask_no_entity", "response_bad_incorrect", "prompt_complex", "complexity_type_adding_conditionals", "complexity_type_multiple_subtasks"]}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "{\n    \"na101\": {\n    }\n}", "rejected": "{\n\"sf456\": {\n     },\n\"tnr789\": {\n     }\n}", "model": "NOW_LLM_llama13b_convclass_dpo_12723_nonpairwise_loss", "snaprejected": "{\n\"sf456\": {\n     },\n\"tnr789\": {\n     }\n}", "snapchosen": "{\n    \"na101\": {\n    }\n}"}]
