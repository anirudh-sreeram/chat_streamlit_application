Healthy protein sources include eggs, nuts, lean meats, fish, and dairy.\n\nProteins are a large category of molecules that support cell structure, immune function, movement, chemical reactions, hormone synthesis, and more. They\u2019re all made up of tiny building blocks called amino acids. Nine of these are essential\u2013meaning your body needs them but can\u2019t make them on its own, so you need to get them in your diet.\n\nNot only is protein essential for your health but consuming it can keep you feeling full and satisfied, which supports a healthy body weight.\n\nThe recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for protein is set at 0.36 grams (g) of protein per pound of your body weight (0.8 g per kilogram). Remember that this reflects the minimum protein required to meet your body\u2019s needs.\n\nChicken breast is an excellent choice if you\u2019re trying to increase your protein intake. In addition to protein, chicken provides a variety of B vitamins, plus minerals like zinc and selenium.\n\n\n- Recipes:\n  BF315: Broccoli, beef, bell pepper, beef stock, soy sauce\n  CP999: Chickpeas, tomatoes, moroccan spices, zucchini, yogurt\n  ZC156: Zucchini, potatoes, cheese, eggs, flour\n  EG665: Eggs, cheese, tomatoes, bell pepper, sour cream\n  CH468: Rice, cream of chicken soup, canned chicken, milk, cheese\n  CH287: Potatoes, cheese, sour cream, cream of chicken soup, garlic salt\n  TN879: Rice, tuna, cheese, frozen vegetables, cream of chicken soup\n  PK318: Pork chops, salsa, cilantro, corn, bell pepper\n  SH469: Linguine, shrimp, cream cheese, broccoli, tomatoes"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Protein is contained in items such as meat, fish and dairy, as well as nuts and legumes.

Chcikpeas and zucchini are two separate entities that provide protein.  Finally, although not listed in the description, eggs are present in the ingredients list for the dish labeled \"EG665\", providing another source of protein to go along with the cheese and tomatoes.
