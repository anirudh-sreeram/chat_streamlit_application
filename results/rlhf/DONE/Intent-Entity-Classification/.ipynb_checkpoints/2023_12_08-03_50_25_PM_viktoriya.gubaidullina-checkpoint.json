I was on a business trip to San Diego and I need help in submitting my expense reports. It is imperative that I submit them in a timely manner. I have difficulties with attaching receipts and inability to allocate expenses correctly. \nCould you please provide the assistance on how to resolve these issues promptly?\"\n\nInstructions:\n\nYou are an IT support system that helps to prioritize the incoming employees requests. You should read the utterance and define the best intent that it matches. You can choose only one intent. Also, extract all relevant slots and their values. \nAll intents are provided in json format. \nEach intent has a unique ID associated with it that contains an upper case letters, numbers and lower case letters in a random combinations.\nFor each intent there are also slots associated with them.  Each slot will have a name, datatype, and description.  It may also include a field PossibleValues which means the slot must match one of the provided values. If any other values are present in the utterance, do not extract them, return \"none\" as the key value for the slot. If multiple slots are provided, fill all the slots.\nI want you to give your final output as a JSON.  The JSON should always have a key \u201coutput\u201d.  The value of \u201coutput\u201d should be a dictionary where the key of this dictionary is the intent id and the values is a subdictionary where the keys are the slot ids associated with the given intent and the values are the slot values. If you return your answer using slotNames you'll be punished.\n\n\n", "tags": ["subtask_multi_entity", "subtask_single_intent", "input_JSON", "input_Markdown", "input_Freeform", "complexity_type_adding_conditionals", "complexity_type_meta_instructions", "complexity_type_multiple_input_formats", "complexity_type_noise", "complexity_type_multiple_subtasks", "prompt_complex", "output_JSON", "num_intents_5", "response_bad_instructionFollowing", "response_bad_misclassification"]}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "{\n    \"output\": {\n        \"CIq57930\": {\n            \"InT739049\": [\n                \"SystemConcern\",\n                \"ExpenseReports\"\n            ]\n            \"EXCat4792\": \"TravelCosts\",\n            \"TrBo00023\": \"none\",\n            \"CSIss1839\": [\n                \" issues with registering my account in the system\",\n                \" difficulties with attaching receipts\",\n                \" inability to allocate expenses correctly \",\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}", "rejected": "{\n    \"output\": {\n        \"RSinst7541\": {\n            \"SoftwareName\": \"None\",\n            \"Version\": \"None\",\n            \"Vendor\": \"None\"\n        }\n    }\n}", "model": "NOW_LLM_llama13b_convclass_dpo_pairwise_loss"}]
