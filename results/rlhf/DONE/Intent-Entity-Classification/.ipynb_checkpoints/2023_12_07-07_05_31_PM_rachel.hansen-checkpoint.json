I'm also having issues with my calendar not being correct. I have an event tomorrow at 9am (Meeting with Jane Goodall), and i've added it to my calendar on my computer, but it is not appearing on my phone - I have an iPhone 15 and have never had an issue like this before. I refreshed a million times, but nothing is happening. I think there may be an issue with outlook because my personal google calendar is working properly. I'm also getting an error \"ERROR 401\". Please direct me to someone I can discuss this issue with. My email is myemail@email.com. My phone number is 666-999-4444. I look forward to hearing from you. \n\n--------------\n\nAdditional Instructions\n\nIf the intent is not identified within the phrase, do not include the intent or its entities in the response. If the intent is identified, only include the entities that are identified within that intent. If there is no entity, do not include that ID. Your entire response should be in YAML format. For the intents, be sure to include the description as the value for your YAML entry. For the entities, the key should be ID and the value should be the extracted information from the phrase. \n\nMy favorite color is purple and I really like to eat pumpkin pie for thanksgiving.
