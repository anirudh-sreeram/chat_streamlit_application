Since I\u2019m sure people are curious, the Japan trip was good and worth doing. I met maybe a half dozen customers, did a marketing event, and did a couple of internal meetings with folks both on my team and on the broader ServiceNow team working there.\n \n                On one level, I do enjoy Japan. It\u2019s a very hospitable, safe, culture where you can pretty much assume everything works and will work. If you ask for a coffee with 2% milk in it, your coffee will have 2% milk in it, not skim, not whole, and certainly not soy milk. Everything in your hotel room will work. The food at the restaurant will be excellent and, even if you don\u2019t like Japanese food, you can find some kind of international food you will like without breaking a sweat. You can sit alone at lunch in a restaurant, leave your laptop there, and go to the restroom in absolute confidence that laptop will still be there when you get back.\n \n                In short, it\u2019s a high functioning, high trust, society with a strong service culture, which makes it a great place to visit as a tourist. It is, however, a challenging place to do business for a couple of reasons. One is pretty tactical, and that is that, for an English speaker, Japan can be hard. A lot of Japanese signage has English subtitles, and most Japanese people have enough high school English to introduce themselves, but very, very, few Japanese business leaders speak conversational English, and a similarly small number of western business leaders speak business quality Japanese.\n \n                That means most business meetings are conducted either via stop-start translation or, for my benefit, in English. In a lot of those latter cases though, I\u2019m often suspicious that I\u2019m not able to make myself fully understood by my audience, and it similarly feels a bit disrespectful to be forcing them to interact in a foreign language in their own country, so I generally prefer translation unless the executive I am meeting is truly English fluent. For meetings, its usually done with a single translator so I\u2019ll have to speak a few sentences, pause, let the translator translate, then continue, which makes everything take twice as long as it feels like it should.\n \n                Another challenge is that Japan has a very, very, conservative business culture. I\u2019m sure there is a socio-historical reason why things ended up the way they are, and I have my own private speculations, but for purposes of this discussion the \u201chow did we get here\u201d aspect is out of scope. My experience though has been that Japanese business culture is highly risk averse. They want to see case studies from similar industries before they\u2019ll consider your product at all, they\u2019ll want to trial it extensively before purchasing, and they\u2019ll purchase in nibbles rather than bites, preferring to buy a few hundred licenses a quarter as usage expands instead of just buying the full project package on day zero, even at a discount.\n \n                There\u2019s also a layer of tragedy buried beneath the placid waters of the business world. A lot of Japanese business leaders will privately tell you they recognize they need to reform their economy. The old ways of doing things are barely keeping society working. They have been papering over a growing labor shortage just by expecting the shrinking labor force to just plain work harder, for longer hours. Many of their best and their brightest emigrate to more dynamic societies where their talents can, and often do, leader to quicker advancement and opportunities.\n \n                This isn\u2019t some secret fact, known only to the business elite, it\u2019s fairly openly discussed within Japanese society, to the point where there are explicit government programs aimed at reforming aspects of the socio-economic system. There\u2019s actually a massive Japanese legislative package dating back before COVID that roughly translates as \u201cwork style reform\u201d, whose aim is to increase worker protections and basically reduce the (often unpaid) overwork that has become endemic to many parts of the economy. I think it remains to be seen how effective this will be, but it is at least evidence that the government A) is aware of the problem and B) is sincerely trying to address it.\n \n                The reason I say it\u2019s tragic though is that there\u2019s sort of a layer cake effect at work within many of the firms we work with. The upper leadership has advanced their careers sufficiently to see over the social horizon and focus on long term things, like large scale reforms. The know change is necessary, they want to make it, and they often view technology as a means to an end, a way to help restore the efficiency and productivity of the overall Japanese economy.\n \n                Similarly, at the bottom of the cake, you have your younger workers. They are early enough in their careers that they have little to lose if companies make changes, and potentially a lot to gain. They are generally well versed with technology, well educated, and more emotionally able to deal with a changing environment than their middle age peers. They want change as well, and they see alternate systems and business approaches elsewhere in the world, and they think \u201cwhy not give it a shot here in Japan\u201d.\n \n                In the middle of the cake though, many Japanese firms have an extremely conservative middle management layer that does not want to change the status quo in any meaningful way. Raw self-interest may be a part of it, in that many of them have committed years to their career in more junior, often very difficult capacities, and are just now reaching a career tipping point where the overall hierarchical system is a net benefit for them. You don\u2019t have to assume that kind of motivation though to recognize that somebody at the mid point of their career has invested a lot in the current system and doesn\u2019t generally *want* to change the rules of the game when they are halfway through.\n \n                So the net result is that a lot of Japanese senior executive meeting are high quality and, within the social constructs of Japanese society, quite frank. Meaningful discussions of potential problem and opportunities happen, and you often walk out with a set of followups to see if the idea you had at the top level meeting is really viable or not. And then, more often than not, things bog down. Investigation gets rolled down the org chart into the extremely conservative middle management layer, and even the best of ideas get nibbled, evaluated, reduced, and ultimately discarded far more often than not.\n \n                It\u2019s not impossible for a Japanese company to change of course; many of them do, and we have a number of excellent customers there doing really cool, innovative stuff with our products (and even more generally with technology). This is, after all, the same culture whose companies dominated the global electronics and consumer products industry of the 1980s, and who grew into the world\u2019s second largest economy in about fourty years from the rubble of WWII. It is, in short, *capable* of change and adoption, but, in my experience, it is harder than in any other economy I\u2019ve done business in my career.\n \n                So I\u2019m something of a sympathetic realist with regards to Japan. I\u2019m sympathetic because I really enjoy the people, and the culture, and have a lot of respect for its achievements along with its potential. I truly want to see the kind of widespread modernization the Japanese economy needs, and I truly think our products and software can help. I\u2019m a realist though in that I recognize the unique cultural dynamics at work, and I recognize that these kinds of changes are not easy, and take time.\n \n                I am a bit hearted though by the recognition that Japan has historically evolved in sort of sprints and crawls. There will be long periods of slow, almost static, social structures, and then an era of rapid, evolutionary changes that rival anything seen anywhere in the world. It remains a culture with the capability to reinvent itself at warp speed if the collective will or motivation emerges. My reading of the current social climate there is that it\u2019s not, quite, there yet, but I do think the combined pressure of the current demographic crisis, and the opportunity offered by modern technologies, may drive that kind of epical change within my the next decade.\n \n                Am I sure I\u2019m right? Of course not; it\u2019s always dangerous for an outsider to speculate on a culture as complex as Japan, so I recognize the limits of my prognostication. Still, I am ultimately optimisic about how this story ends, because I do think Japan retains the ability to reinvent itself when it needs to, and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing what comes next.", "tags": ["subtask_multi_entity", "output_JSON", "input_Freeform", "task_entity_extraction", "complexity_type_including_examples", "complexity_type_meta_instructions", "complexity_type_noise", "prompt_complex", "response_bad_irrelevantInformation", "response_bad_misclassification", "response_bad_formatError"]}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "{\n    \"entities\": {\n        \"beverages\": [\n            \"coffee\",\n            \"milk\"\n        ],\n        \"milk_types\": [\n            \"2%\",\n            \"skim\",\n            \"whole\",\n            \"soy\"\n        ],\n        \"languages\": [\n            \"Japanese\",\n            \"English\"\n        ]\n        }\n}", "rejected": "Observations about Japan:\n{\n    \"entities\": {\n        \"beverages\": [\n            \"coffee\"\n        ],\n        \"milk_types\": [],\n        \"languages\": []\n    }\n}", "model": "NOW_LLM_llama13b_convclass_dpo_pairwise_loss"}]
