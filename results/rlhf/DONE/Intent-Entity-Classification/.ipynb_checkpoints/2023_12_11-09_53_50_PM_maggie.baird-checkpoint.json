It makes me want to make ice cream cakes. I'm in law school and man it's just not fulfilling me in the way I want. I'm only one semester in so it's like I better commit or quit you know what I mean? What hours do you guys have? Like do you have people up all night constructing the cakes, or is it just like during the day? Is the ice-cream made inhouse? Cause it's not like a chain or anything, I've never seen one anywhere else. If you do, you should have tours or something! Or like a mascot. Like a penguin! Or a lizard. Because it's the animals in the hot that would really need cold food if you think about it. Anyhow you guys are the best man", "tags": ["subtask_multi_entity", "complexity_type_noise", "task_entity_extraction", "response_bad_incorrect", "response_bad_irrelevantInformation", "response_bad_instructionFollowing", "input_JSON", "input_Freeform", "output_JSON", "prompt_complex"]}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "{}", "rejected": "{\n    \"message\": \"Yooooooo we just had one of your cakes...\",\n    \"baseflavor\": \"ginormous\",\n    \"add_flavor\": \"candy cane\",\n    \"date\": \"Christmas\"\n}", "model": "NOW_LLM_llama13b_convclass_dpo_pairwise_loss"}]
