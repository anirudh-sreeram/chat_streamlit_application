Also I want you to extract all relevant slots and their values if present in the utterance.\nImportant details to consider:\n\u2022 Each intent has a unique ID associated with it that starts with the 2 upper case letters, 1 lower case letter and 3 numbers:   in total the intent id is a 6 characters long. Each intent has its name and description.\nIf no intents can be identified, please return N/A. \n\n\u2022 For each intent there are also slots associated with them. Those are values that need to be retrieved for a particular intent.  Each slot has a slotId, slotName,  and also includes specific Values, which means the slot must match one of the provided values. If multiple slots are provided for the intent, fill all the slots. The list of the provided values for each slot is exhausted and limited to the mentioned values, meaning that no other value if present in the utterance and not matching the stated list should be extracted for the corresponding slot. In this case return \"none\" for the slot value. If a slot value is not provided, set the value of the slot to \"none\".\n\n\u2022 I want your response to be only in Json format. The JSON should always have a key \u201coutput\u201d. The value of \u201coutput\u201d should be a dictionary where the key of this dictionary is the intent id and the values is a sub-dictionary where the keys are the slot ids associated with the given intent and the values are the slot values. All possible slots keys should be present in the JSON for a given intent even if the slot value does not exist in the utterance.\n\n\n# utterance:\n\n\"Baklava is a delicious Greek dessert. Originally from Turkey, Greece, and the Middle East, but it was brought to Hungary by Turkish invaders during the 16th century. Hungary revised it and made it part of their culture as the strudel. Baklava is the perfect make-ahead dessert because it's even better the next day!\nSome baking tips: \nBuy 450 g of hazelnuts.\nPrepare a 9\u201dx 13\u201dx 2\u201d baking pan.\nBake: Place the baking dish on the middle rack of your preheated to 180\u00b0C oven and keep this baking temperature for the whole period of baking time. For best results bake for about 45 minutes or until the top of the baklava turns golden and a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the baklava cool completely (it's best if you leave it for several hours, or at least 1 hour. \"", "tags": ["subtask_no_entity", "subtask_single_intent", "complexity_type_adding_conditionals", "complexity_type_input_format", "complexity_type_meta_instructions", "complexity_type_multiple_subtasks", "complexity_type_noise", "input_Freeform", "input_Lists", "task_combination", "response_bad_incorrect", "output_JSON", "num_intents_5", "prompt_complex"]}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "{\n    \"prediction_intent\": \"Baklava\",\n    \"output\": {\n        \"BAc756\": {\n            \"Ingv74\": \"none\",\n            \"Dogh57\": \"none\",\n            \"Nurt21\": \"none\",\n            \"Bate74\": \"none\",\n            \"Btii48\": \"none\"\n        }\n    }\n}", "rejected": "{\n    \"output\": {\n        \"None\": {}\n    }\n}>", "model": "NOW_LLM_llama13b_convclass_dpo_pairwise_loss"}]
