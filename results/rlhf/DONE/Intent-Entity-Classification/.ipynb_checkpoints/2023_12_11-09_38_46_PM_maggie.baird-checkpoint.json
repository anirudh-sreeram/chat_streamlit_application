There's going to be 6 of us celebrating. I was looking on the website and I know that it says a base flavor has to be vanilla or chocolate, but I was wondering if we could do the whole thing as cotton candy - it's his favorite. Can you write \"Happy Birthday Jason\" on it and draw a rabbit on it. We'll need to pick up the cake next Friday, August 21.
