The combination of heavy cream and Gruy\u00e8re makes it rich and flavorful. There\u2019s also a good bit of spinach, which balances out all that richness and makes it just a little bit healthier. To simplify things, it is recommended using a store-bought crust. Frozen chopped spinach also makes the recipe easy. It\u2019s important to wring out all the moisture from the spinach before using.  The cooked quiche can be frozen for up to 3 months. Remove the quiche from the freezer about 24 hours prior to eating and reheat it, covered with foil, in a 300\u00b0F oven until hot in the center.\"\n\n# Instructions:\nThe following utterance is an extract from the recipe. Please identify in the list of the intents provided above the intent that best matches this utterance. \nImportant details to consider:\n- Each intent has a unique ID associated with it that starts with the 2 upper case letters followed by 5 numbers: total is a 7 characters long. Each intent has its name and description.\nYou should not assign the intent to the utterance even if a slight deviation is present in the intent description.\nIf no intents can be identified, please return: {\u201cprediction_intent\u201d: \u201cnone _of_the_above\u201d}. \n\n- For each intent there are also slots associated with them. Those are unique values that need to be retrieved for a particular intent.  Each slot has a name and also includes  specific Values, which means the slot must match one of the provided values. The list of the provided values for each slot is exhausted, meaning that no other value if present in the utterance should be extracted. In this case return \"none\" for the slot value. If multiple slots are provided, fill all the slots.   If a slot  value is not provided, set the value of the slot to \"none\". \n\n- I want your response to be in Json format. The JSON should always have a key \u201coutput\u201d.  The value of \u201coutput\u201d should be a dictionary where the key of this dictionary is the intent id and the values is a sub-dictionary where the keys are the slots associated with the given intent and the values are the corresponding slot values.  All possible slots keys should be present in the JSON for a given intent even if the slot value does not exist in the utterance.  If the output is not within this format, you will be heavily penalized. \n\n\n\n", "tags": ["task_combination", "input_Freeform", "input_Lists", "num_intents_4", "prompt_complex", "complexity_type_adding_conditionals", "complexity_type_meta_instructions", "complexity_type_noise", "output_JSON", "response_bad_formatError", "subtask_no_intent", "subtask_no_entity", "subtask_OOD_intent", "response_bad_ conciseness"]}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "{\n    \"prediction_intent\": \"none_of_the_above\"\n}", "rejected": "None of the intents listed in the reference text correspond to the information provided in the utterance.
