You are provided with the list of some types of claims cases that were submitted by the passengers to airline companies.  There is also a list of important mandatory details (slots) that a customer should include when submitting a claim.\n\nIntents: \nEach intent has a unique ID, associated with it, that consists of four upper case letters, 2 numbers, a name and intent description. It may also include  possibleValues which means the slot must match one of the provided values. Please acquaint yourself with the specific definition of each intent by reading the descriptions associated with each intent and understanding the constraints required for each intent.\nSlots: For each intent there are also slots associated with them.  Slots are values that need to be retrieved for a particular intent.  Each slot will have a  unique ID that starts with1 lower case letter followed by 3 numbers,  name and description. It could also include a field exampleValues where examples are given but the extracted slots do not need to exactly match those given values.  \n\nGo through the information available in the customer's claim (the utterance below) and assign the relevant document type. To give the correct answer use the list of the intents (types of claims) provided above. Also extract all relevant slots and their values. If multiple slots are provided, fill all the slots.  If a slot value is not provided, set the value of the slot to \"none\".\n If some slots that are present in the utterance were not provided, ignore them and do not extract.\n\nReturn your answer in json.\nThe JSON should always have a key \u201coutput\u201d.

If intent can't be identified, please return: {\"prediction_intent\": \"None\"}.\nBe sure to extract  and fill the slots in the order they were provided in the list above : from \"s001\" to \"s014\".\n\n# Utterance:\n\nDear SnowStarWings,\nI'm writing to file a claim regarding the delay of my flight # BG145 scheduled  for departure from Phoenix on 18.03.21 at 10.00 am. The delay was caused by unprecedented snowstorm that led to the closer of the airport and disrupted normal flight operations. As a result of the bad meteorological conditions my flight was delayed by 11 hours , causing me significant inconvenience .I missed the connecting flight and had to incur additional expenses during the extended delay period. I kindly request compensation or appropriate assistance with accordance with the airline policies.\nSincerely,\nEmma Grey,\n3-555-555-55-55", "tags": ["response_bad_hallucination", "response_bad_instructionFollowing", "response_bad_irrelevantInformation", "task_combination", "input_Freeform", "input_Lists", "input_Markdown", "subtask_multi_entity", "subtask_single_intent", "complexity_type_adding_conditionals", "complexity_type_input_format", "complexity_type_including_examples", "complexity_type_noise", "prompt_complex", "output_JSON", "num_intents_4"]}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "{\n    \"output\": {\n        \"Code FDFM\": {\n            \"s001\": \"Emma Grey\",\n            \"s002\": \"3-555-555-55-55\",\n            \"s003\": \"None\",\n            \"s004\": \"None\",\n            \"s005\": \"SnowStarWings\",\n            \"s006\": \"BG145\",\n            \"s007\": \"None\",\n            \"s008\": \"Phoenix\",\n            \"s009\": \"18.03.21\",\n            \"s010\": \"11 hours\",\n            \"s011\": \"11\",\n            \"s012\": \"None\",\n            \"s013\": \"18.03.21\"\n        }\n    }\n}", "rejected": "{\n    \"output\": {\n        \"FLDC02\": {\n            \"s009\": \"18.03.21\",\n            \"s010\": \"10.00 am\",\n            \"s011\": \"11\",\n            \"s003\": \"Phoenix\",\n            \"s004\": \"BG145\",\n            \"s008\": \"Phoenix\",\n            \"s002\": \"3-555-555-55-55\",\n            \"s007\": \"None\",\n            \"s012\": \"None\",\n            \"s013\": \"None\",\n            \"s014\": \"None\"\n        }\n    }\n}", "model": "NOW_LLM_llama13b_convclass_dpo_pairwise_loss"}]
