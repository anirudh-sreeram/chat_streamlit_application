You cannot use your savings account because it does not meet the requirements necessary to complete an Interac eTransfer. Opening a chequing account may be beneficial if you plan on using this service often as they offer more freedom when making payments. However, opening a new account is not strictly necessary in order to perform this single transaction; it all depends on how frequently you anticipate utilizing this feature and whether or not the added functionality of a checking account would prove useful in those scenarios.
