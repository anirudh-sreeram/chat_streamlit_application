[{"role": "context", "content": "Below are six intents related to ordering food from a restaurant through an online service.\n\nThe INTENT_ID is 3310303FR of the first intent, ADDTOCART, which is when a customer wants to add an item to their shopping cart. It has associated slots as follows: ITEM_ID, ITEM_DESC, NUMBER. An example of these slots would be BS3123, garlic naan, two. Next intent is APPLYDISCOUNT used to apply a discount to the user's order. It has an INTENT_ID of 310054FF and a slot that corresponds to the discount code, i.e., DISC_CODE. An example is WELCOME20, that applies 20% off a new user's order. A third intent is SPECIALINSTRUCTIONS. This is the intent to provide special instructions for the preparation of the order. This intent can ONLY be used to specify an allergy. The INTENT_ID is SPEC1333 and the slot is ALLERGY_TYPE, which can be filled with the user's allergy, i.e., peanut allergy. The fourth intent has an INTENT_ID of 44213REM and is REMOVEFROMCART. It is used to remove an item from the user's shopping cart and the slots are ITEM_ID, ITEM_DESC, and NUMBER. The fifth intent is CALCULATETOTAL and is the intent to calculate the total cost of the user's order (item cost plus 13% taxes). It has an INTENT_ID of 57583TTT and the following slots:  ORDER_SUBTOTAL (sum of all order items), TAX_AMOUNT (the 13% tax applied to the subtotal), DELIVERY_FEE (4 dollars), DISCOUNT_AMOUNT (the discount applied to the subtotal if applicable) and TOTAL (subtotal summed with the tax amount and delivery fee, minus the discount). All values are numerical with two decimal places, for example, 25.33 (no dollar sign should be included). The slot of DELIVERY_FEE always has a slot value of 4.00.\n\nHere are a list of possible items to be ordered:\nEdamame (Boiled Soybeans) - $4.50\nMiso Soup - $3.20\nCalifornia Roll - $7.80\nSpicy Salmon Roll - $8.20\nVegetable Tempura - $9.60\nChicken Teriyaki - $13.90\nBeef Negimaki - $15.50\nGrilled Salmon - $17.20\nIce Cream - $5.00, possible values: Green Tea, Red Bean\n\nHere are some discount codes that could be applied:\nVEGANDEAL - A discount or special offer when ordering from vegan restaurants.\nHEALTHYEATS - Get a percentage off when you order healthy food options.\nUBEREATS10 - 10% off your first Uber Eats order. This code is often used to attract new customers.\nSAVE5OFF - Save $5 if your order is over $20 (before tax).\nSTUDENTDISCOUNT - Special discount for students. Usually requires verification through a .edu email address.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Below are six intents related to ordering food from a restaurant through an online service.\n\nThe INTENT_ID is 3310303FR of the first intent, ADDTOCART, which is when a customer wants to add an item to their shopping cart.

And please switch the california roll for the spicy salmon roll. I am a student and want the discount applied. Also, I have a peanut allergy, so really need to make sure there is no cross contamination. Thanks!\n\nProvide a json with the key \"order_details\" and the value being a dictionary with keys as INTENT_ID of the intents whose description match the customer utterance and values being a subdictionary with keys as the slots and their corresponding values extracted from the utterance. If a value cannot be extracted for a particular slot, return \"?\" for that slot value. Use reasoning to determine if a discount code applies, for example, if the order total meets a certain threshold to apply a discount and include this as a key in the subdictionary. Similarly, use reasoning to calculate the total and provide chain of thought as a key in the subdictionary if this intent is assigned to the customer utterance.
