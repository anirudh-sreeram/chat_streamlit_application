I still had a baby tooth because an adult tooth never formed underneath it. While the baby tooth is technically a 'molar', but adult tooth is actually a premolar that was supposed to come in late childhood before the adult molars come in and way before the wisdom teeth come in. Because this baby tooth didn't come out until I was in my twenties, I never got a tooth fairy money for this lil tooth.
