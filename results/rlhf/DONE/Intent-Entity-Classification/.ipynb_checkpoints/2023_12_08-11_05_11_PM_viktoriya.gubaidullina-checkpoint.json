Please identify in the list of the intents provided above the intent that best matches this utterance. \nImportant details to consider:\n\n- Each intent has a unique ID associated with it that starts with the 2 upper case letters followed by 6 numbers: total is a 8 characters long. Each intent has its name and description.\nYou should not assign the intent to the utterance even if a slight deviation is present in the intent description.\nIf no intents can be identified, please return: {\u201cprediction_intent\u201d: \u201cnone _of_the_above\u201d}. \n\n- For each intent there are also slots associated with them. Those are unique values that need to be retrieved for a particular intent.  Each slot has a name and also includes specific Values, which means the slot must match one of the provided values. If multiple slots are provided, fill all the slots.   The list of the provided values for each slot is exhausted and limited to the mentioned values,  meaning that no other value if present in the utterance  and not matching  the stated list should be extracted for the corresponding slot. In this case return \"none\" for the slot value.   If a slot  value is not provided, set the value of the slot to \"none\". \n\n- I want your response to be only in Json format. The JSON should always have a key \u201coutput\u201d.  The value of \u201coutput\u201d should be a dictionary where the key of this dictionary is the intent id and the values is a sub-dictionary where the keys are the slot ids associated with the given intent and the values are the slot values.  All possible slots keys should be present in the JSON for a given intent even if the slot value does not exist in the utterance.  If the output is not within this format, you will be heavily penalized. \n\nThe utterance:\n\"The average coffee shop blueberry muffin is hardly what you'd call a health food: It's got almost 470 calories\u2014nearly double what you'd get from a chocolate frosted donut\u2014and most of those calories come from refined carbohydrates, primarily white flour and sugar.\nHow Do You Make Best Home Baked Blueberry Muffins?\nHere's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade blueberry muffins:\n\n1.
