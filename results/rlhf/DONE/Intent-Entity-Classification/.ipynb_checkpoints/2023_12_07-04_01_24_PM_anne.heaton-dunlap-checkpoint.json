He had been accused of impiety, which is to say failing to respect the appropriate gods of the city of Athens, and corrupting the young, which is a bit vaguer but seems to have largely involved the political implications of his philosophical ideas. According to most accounts, Socrates\u2019s actual death was delayed by a couple of weeks, during which he had the opportunity to flee the city, but he opted instead to stay and accept his punishment, ultimately ending his life by drinking hemlock tea.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You can make of his particular story what you will; to this author it\u2019s pretty unarguable that Socrates was something of a pain , and sufficiently self-righteous that he\u2019d rather die to prove a philosophical point than flee and save his own life. He literally preferred being right to being alive. The combination, along with a variety of interesting personal habits, like refusing to bathe, or change his clothes, and wandering the acropolis while accusing random people of sinfulness, didn\u2019t endear him to the average Athenian citizen. In that context, it\u2019s a bit of a surprise that only 280 of his 500 jurors chose the death penalty, while a substantial minority (220) were willing to tolerate him just on the principal that, however much of a pain he was, it really ought not to be a capital crime.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To me the interesting point though has more to do with the way the Athenian justice system worked, and, by extension, the way the entire Athenian government worked, because Athens was a very pure direct democracy. The citizens of Athens could, and did, put people to death by majority vote. They could launch a war on the same terms. They could take the property from one and give it to another, they could use public funds to build a monument, or tear one down. In point of fact the Athenians could do essentially anything by majority vote, without any underlying structural constraints. The will of the majority, as expressed via a vote, was the will of the state.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the ancient Greek works, this was an incredibly destabilizing, and hence dangerous, political philosophy that threatened to upset the existing social order of Greece. The Greeks understood autocracies, where one human being (almost always a man in the Greek world) ruled by fiat. They also understood Oligarchies, where a group of people (again, generally men in the Greek world) ruled via some form of shared power structure, but democracy was new, it was revolutionary, and it was destabilizing.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Democratic Athens was a dynamic, revolutionary power, preaching a new form of social organization across the Greek world, gaining converts along the way. Her foreign policy was destabilizing, in that she actively tried to bring down oligarchic or autocratic governments and replace them with direct democracies on the Athenian model. She was also one of the richest, most powerful, polities in the Greek world, who used that wealth and power to drive her revolutionary policies. Equally importantly, her citizenry was energetic, motivated, and drove the city from success to success.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The end of that particular story was something called the Peloponnesian war where, over the course of thirty years of brutal warfare, a conservative, Spartan led coalition of other Greek states eventually overwhelmed and defeated the Athenian alliance system. The war itself was a tragedy for Greek civilization as a whole, not just for Athens, but I covered that in an entirely different essay and I don\u2019t want to rehash it here. What I do want to do though is dwell a bit on the fact that, in the ancient world at least, Democracy was a revolutionary, often violent, political philosophy that had no qualms whatsoever about putting a man to death, just because he smelled bad and liked to shout obscenities in the agora.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To a modern eye that sounds sort of weird, because the colloquial description of Democracy we use today doesn\u2019t really match the way the Greeks understood it. The modern, colloquial, definition of democracy is of representative political systems, characterized by strong individual rights and social protections, generally coupled with a status quo foreign policy. In the modern definition of democracy Socrates could never be killed, because, no matter how many people voted him dead, the judicial system would protect his underlying right to keep on living, even if he was a pain, and even if he did yell at people in the agora. Similarly, I\u2019ve seen modern arguments that democratic states don\u2019t make war on each other, but historical Athens, which happily invaded democratic Syracuse, would beg to differ.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In one sense, that\u2019s unsurprising, in that political philosophies evolve over time, and modern polities are much more complex entities than an ancient Greek city state. So it shouldn\u2019t surprise anybody that we don\u2019t run our society the same way that ancient Athens did. I\u2019ll go on record as saying I think that\u2019s a good thing, in that I think trying to run modern society by the exact same political rules they used back then would lead to the collapse of modern society in a few weeks, with dogs and cats living together, mass hysteria, and probably a plague of locusts to boot.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At another level though, it is a bit of a surprise because both the Athenians, and many modern states, would still call their political system democracy. They used the same word. Even in the modern world there\u2019s a vast spectrum of political philosophies all of which call themselves democracies and all of whom claim that the policies of their opponents are \u201cundemocratic\u201d. On one end of the political spectrum you\u2019ll see people arguing that populist political parties are \u201cundemocratic\u201d because they (often) don\u2019t respect minority rights, while on the other end of the spectrum you\u2019ll have the populists arguing that the more status quo political parties are \u201cundemocratic\u201d because they (often) represent the interests and beliefs of an educated minority, rather than the more numerous other social classes which outvote them based on raw numbers.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You don\u2019t have to take a side anywhere on that or any similar political debate to recognize that the word \u201cdemocracy\u201d is being used to describe two significantly different political philosophies, which means that both sides of the debate can, and do, point to their desired definition of the word and claim to be true democrats. There\u2019s a certain political currency in that as well, in that most of us live in societies which believe democracy in the abstract sense is a good thing, and hence it\u2019s politically valuable to be able to call yourself a true democrat, and accuse your opponents of being something else like fascists, communists, elitists, populists, etc.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I\u2019m an engineer, and I tend to like neat, well documented definitions for things, so this lack of a true objective definition for democracy in modern English bothers me. I\u2019d much prefer if we had a well understood, and agreed upon, definition for \u201cdemocracy\u201d even if such a definition didn\u2019t match the one in use in ancient Athens. The meaning of words evolves over time, and I\u2019d be fine if we all wrote down and agreed to a definition of democracy that didn\u2019t let us vote somebody like Socrates to death just because we don\u2019t like him.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I\u2019m also a realist though, and I just don\u2019t see that happening. There are far too many people, across far too many nooks and crannies of the political spectrum, who all want to call themselves \u201ctrue\u201d democrats, and who all believe that their subjective definition of democracy is the correct one. The odds of us all getting together as a society and agreeing on one specific definition as the correct one will inevitably cause everybody else with a different definition to object, and we\u2019ll be back in an endless spin cycle.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The upshot of that lack of a subjective definition though is that it sort of makes arguments that certain political positions are either truly democratic, or deeply undemocratic, white noise in the political spectrum. If none of us can agree on what democracy means in the modern era, then it\u2019s pointless to argue about who gets to claim their policies are more democratic than their opponents. It can make good political theatre of course, and politics is at least partially about the theatrical elements, but as an objective measure to assess policies its sort of useless.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So my advice on this front is, twofold. First of all, it\u2019s to recognize that, while you probably have your own subjective sense of what \u201cdemocratic\u201d means, it probably does not align with that of everybody else in your society and across the political spectrum. Plenty of other people you disagree with may have their own, different, but sincerely held definition of democracy. Second, it\u2019s to recognize that, absent an agreed definition, there\u2019s no point in arguing whether or not a policy is democratic or not, but we rather ought to be arguing whether or not it\u2019s a *good policy* or not.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There are, of course, various measures of good, but if we start debating a policy on the good/bad spectrum we generally have to start defining our variables. Is a policy good for economic reasons? Moral reasons? National Security reasons? Etc. There are various flavors of the good/bad spectrum we can use to have productive policy debates, but my experience is the democratic/undemocratic spectrum is not a useful mechanism to sort out whether we ought to be supportive of a policy or not.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The irony of all of this is that, despite our definitional deficit, the fact that we can have these debates at all can be traced back to those early voters in Athens who put Socrates to death. None of us live in a direct, Athenian style democracy (nor would I want to), and none of us live in societies with a perfectly agreed upon definition of democracy, but almost all of us live in societies which broadly accept the principal that political legitimacy stems from the underlying will, and consent, of the polity as a whole.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That specific concept, that government is an aspect of the governed, rather than something imposed from above, or outside, remains, in many ways, just as revolutionary today as it was back when Athenian hoplites were jogging towards the beach at Marathon. Because, however much we can, and do disagree on the details of what entails true democracy, and however important those distinctions and differences are, the fact remains that the family of what I\u2019ll call broadly \u201cdemocratic\u201d political philosophies does exist in opposition to other, alternative concepts of government and politics. One can both disagree with one\u2019s fellow citizens on the exact definition of democracy is, but still agree that government of the people, by the people, and for the people, is a concept worth fighting for.\n\n", "tags": ["num_intents_7", "output_JSON", "input_JSON", "input_Freeform", "prompt_complex", "task_combination", "subtask_multi_entity", "subtask_single_intent", "complexity_type_input_format", "complexity_type_noise", "complexity_type_multiple_input_formats", "complexity_type_multiple_subtasks", "response_bad_misclassification", "response_bad_instructionFollowing", "response_bad_irrelevantInformation", "response_bad_formatError", "response_bad_hallucination"]}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "{\n    \"Classes\": [\n{\n    \"ClassID\": \"678\",\n    \"ClassDescription\": \"This intent represents the daily life and customs of the ancient Greeks, including their family structures, social norms, political and economic activities.\"\n}\n    ],\n    \"Entities\":\n    [\n        {\n        \"Philosopher\": \"Socrates\"\n        }\n    ]\n}", "rejected": "The text provided discusses various aspects of ancient Greek history, culture, and philosophy.
