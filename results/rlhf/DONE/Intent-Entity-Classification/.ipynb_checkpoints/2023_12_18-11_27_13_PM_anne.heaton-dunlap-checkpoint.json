To receive this benefit, you must submit original receipts showing qualifying adoption expenses within 12 months of the adoption date. You may also be reimbursed for eligible employment-related educational expenses such as tuition fees, books, and course-required software or tools after six months of continuous employment. For more information on these programs, including any forms needed to apply, please refer to the documents available through the HR portal.\nRegarding your question about tuition reimbursement, we offer an Educational Assistance Plan that provides financial assistance to employees who want to continue their education. Employees enrolled in degree programs may be reimbursed for tuition, registration, lab, and other related fees. Books, supplies, parking permits, student activity fees, and similar personal expenses are not covered by this program. Eligible expenses must be work-related and approved by management prior to enrollment. Please review the details on the Education Assistance page of the HR portal for specific guidelines and instructions on submitting claims for reimbursement.", "model": "NOW_LLM_llama13b_convclass_dpo_12723_nonpairwise_loss"}]
