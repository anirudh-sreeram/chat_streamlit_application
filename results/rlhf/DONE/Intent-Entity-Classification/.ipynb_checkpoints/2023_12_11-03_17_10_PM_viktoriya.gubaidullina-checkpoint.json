I am writing to request compensation for my flight  AWD213 from Munich to Texas being delayed due to crew Scheduling issues on 13th of November 2021. I was informed of the delay upon arrival to the airport, that was 3 hours before the scheduled departure time.\n \nI have been unable to make my connecting flight, which significantly impacted my itinerary and caused me to miss important meetings and events. I had unforeseen expenses of 175 usd at the airport during long 5 hours of waiting time before we were able to depart (as a result, I arrived 5 hours late to my destination).\n \nI request that you provide me with a compensation for the inconvenience and disruption caused by the delay. I am willing to provide additional documentation to support my claim, if necessary.\n You can reach out to me by phone: 465-009-2021 or by email: Chip.dayle171@company.com.\nThank you for your time and consideration.\u201d\n\n", "tags": ["response_bad_incorrect", "subtask_multi_entity", "subtask_single_intent", "output_JSON", "num_intents_5", "input_Freeform", "input_Lists", "complexity_type_adding_conditionals", "complexity_type_multiple_input_formats", "complexity_type_multiple_subtasks", "complexity_type_meta_instructions", "complexity_type_input_format"]}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "{\n    \"code\": \"FDC\",\n    \"mandatory_details\": [\n        {\n            \"passenger_name\": \"Chip Dayle\",\n            \"passenger_contact_info\": [\n                \"phone_number\": \"465-009-2021\",\n                \"email\": \"Chip.dayle171@company.com\"\n            ],\n            \"reservation_number\": \"none\",\n            \"ticket_number\": \"none\",\n            \"airline_name\": \"BrightAurora Airlines\",\n            \"flight_number\": \"AWD213\",\n            \"arrival_city\": \"Texas\",\n            \"departure_city\": \"Munich\",\n            \"notification_date\": \"13th of November 2021\",\n            \"notification_time\": \"3 hours prior to departure\",\n            \"delay_period\": \"5 hours\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"amount_due\": \"$400\"\n}", "rejected": "{\n    \"code\": \"FDMC\",\n    \"mandatory_details\": {\n        \"passenger_name\": \"Chip Dayle\",\n        \"contact_information\": \"phone_number: 465-009-2021, email: Chip.dayle171@company.com\",\n        \"reservation_number\": \"none\",\n        \"ticket_number\": \"none\",\n        \"airline_name\": \"BrightAurora Airlines\",\n        \"flight_number\": \"AWD213\",\n        \"arrival_city\": \"Texas\",\n        \"departure_city\": \"Munich\",\n        \"notification_date\": \"13th of November 2021\",\n        \"notification_time\": \"true\",\n        \"delay_period\": \"5\"\n    },\n    \"amount_due\": \"None\"\n}", "model": "NOW_LLM_llama13b_convclass_dpo_pairwise_loss"}]
