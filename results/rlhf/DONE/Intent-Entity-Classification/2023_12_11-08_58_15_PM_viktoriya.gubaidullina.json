There is also a list of important mandatory details (slots) that a customer should include when submitting a claim. Kindly familiarize yourself with the precise definitions of each intent by reviewing the associated descriptions and understanding the constraints for each intent.\n\nIntents: \nEach intent has a unique ID, associated with it, that consists of four uppercase letters, 2 numbers, a name and intent description. It may also include \"possibleValues\" which means the entity in the utterance must match one of the provided values. \nSlots: For each intent there are also slots associated with them.  Slots are values that need to be retrieved for a particular intent.  Each slot has a unique ID that starts with 1 lower case letter followed by 3 numbers and a name. It could also include a field \"example_Values\", where examples are given but the extracted slots do not need to exactly match those given values.  \n\nGo through the information available in the customer's claim (the utterance below) and assign the relevant document type. To give the correct answer use the list of the intents (types of claims) provided. If there are multiple intents, that would match the utterance equally well, make sure to output them all.   Also extract all relevant slots and their values. If multiple slots are provided, fill only the slots present in the utterance. You should fill slots in the order they  appeared in the list provided above (going from s001 to s014). If some slots that are present in the utterance were not provided, ignore them and do not extract. \n\nReturn your answer in json.\nThe JSON should always have a key \u201coutput\u201d. The value of \u201coutput\u201d should be a dictionary where the key of this dictionary is the intent id and the values is a sub-dictionary where the keys are the slot Ids associated with the given intent and the values are the slot values. If intent can't be identified, please return: {\"prediction_intent\": \"None\"}.\nExtract the slots and their possible values only if the relevant intent was assigned to the utterance.\nLastly, determine if the emotional tone of the message is \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\".\n\n\n# Utterance:\n\n\"Hello.\nDue to crew scheduling issues my flight # NB871 on 04 April 2022 was delayed  by 7 hours, leading to the loss of my brown suitcase containing some valuable items. And even this suitcase is a very important thing for me! it was a gift from my brother. The delay caused me to miss my  connecting flight in Frankfurt, compounding the inconvenience. I was notified about the delay only 2 hours before the scheduled departure. I'm so angry! This situation is unacceptable!  I want to be compensated for the traumatic experience I endured with your airline. \nAdam.\" \n\n\n", "rejected": "{\n    \"output\": {\n        \"FLDC02\": {\n            \"s002\": \"none\",\n            \"s003\": \"none\",\n            \"s004\": \"none\",\n            \"s005\": \"Dream Wings\",\n            \"s006\": \"NB871\",\n            \"s007\": \"Frankfurt\",\n            \"s008\": \"none\",\n            \"s009\": \"2 hours before the scheduled departure\",\n            \"s010\": \"2 hours before the scheduled departure\",\n            \"s011\": \"7 hours\",\n            \"s012\": \"none\",\n            \"s013\": \"04 April 2022\",\n            \"s014\": \"none\"\n        },\n        \"DLUG01\": {\n            \"s002\": \"none\",\n            \"s003\": \"none\",\n            \"s004\": \"none\",\n            \"s005\": \"Dream Wings\",\n            \"s006\": \"NB871\",\n            \"s007\": \"Frankfurt\",\n            \"s008\": \"none\",\n            \"s009\": \"2 hours before the scheduled departure\",\n            \"s010\": \"2 hours before the scheduled departure\",\n            \"s011\": \"7 hours\",\n            \"s012\": \"none\",\n            \"s013\": \"04 April 2022\",\n            \"s014\": \"none\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"emotional_tones\": {\n        \"negative\": true\n    }\n}", "chosen": "{\n    \"output\": {\n        \"FLDC02\": {\n            \"s002\": \"1-800-334-45-02\",\n            \"s003\": \"VBH890\",\n            \"s004\": \"14522764111\",\n            \"s005\": \"Dream Wings\",\n            \"s006\": \"VC456\",\n            \"s007\": \"Texas\",\n            \"s008\": \"Texas\",\n            \"s009\": \"n/a\",\n            \"s010\": \"n/a\",\n            \"s011\": \"n/a\",\n            \"s012\": \"joe.dow@company.com\",\n            \"s013\": \"04.04.2022\",\n            \"s014\": \"4:20 pm\",\n            \"emotional_tone\": \"negative\"\n        },\n        \"LOLU05\": {\n            \"s001\": \"Peter White\",\n            \"s002\": \"1-800-334-45-02\",\n            \"s003\": \"VBH890\",\n            \"s004\": \"14522764111\",\n            \"s005\": \"Dream Wings\",\n            \"s006\": \"VC456\",\n            \"s007\": \"Texas\",\n            \"s008\": \"Texas\",\n            \"s009\": \"n/a\",\n            \"s010\": \"n/a\",", "tags": ["response_bad_ conciseness", "response_bad_instructionFollowing", "response_bad_irrelevantInformation", "input_Freeform", "input_Lists", "input_Markdown", "complexity_type_adding_conditionals", "complexity_type_meta_instructions", "complexity_type_multiple_subtasks", "complexity_type_multiple_input_formats", "complexity_type_noise", "num_intents_5", "subtask_multi_entity", "subtask_multi_intent", "prompt_complex", "output_JSON", "task_combination", "response_bad_incorrect"]}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "{\n    \"output\": {\n        \"FLDC02\": {\n            \"possibleValues\": {\n                \"circumstances\": \"crew scheduling issues\"\n            },\n            \"s001\": \"Adam\",\n            \"s006\": \"NB871\",\n            \"s009\": \"04 April 2022\",\n            \"s010\": \"2 hours before the scheduled departure\",\n            \"s011\": \"7 hours\",\n            \"s013\": \"04 April 2022\",\n        },\n        \"LOLU05\": {\n            \"s001\": \"Adam\",\n            \"s006\": \"NB871\",\n            \"s013\": \"04 April 2022\",\n        },\n        \"emotionalTone\": \"negative\",\n    }\n}\n", "rejected": "{\n    \"output\": {\n        \"FLDC02\": {\n            \"s009\": \"04 April 2022\",\n            \"s010\": \"2 hours before the scheduled departure\",\n            \"s011\": \"7 hours\",\n            \"s003\": \"NB871\",\n            \"s004\": \"None\",\n            \"s005\": \"None\",\n            \"s006\": \"None\",\n            \"s007\": \"Frankfurt\",\n            \"s008\": \"None\",\n            \"s012\": \"None\",\n            \"s013\": \"04 April 2022\"\n        },\n        \"LOLU05\": {\n            \"s003\": \"None\",\n            \"s004\": \"None\",\n            \"s005\": \"None\",\n            \"s006\": \"None\",\n            \"s007\": \"None\",\n            \"s008\": \"None\",\n            \"s009\": \"None\",\n            \"s010\": \"None\",\n            \"s011\": \"None\",\n            \"s012\": \"None\",\n            \"s013\": \"None\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"emotional_tone\": \"negative\"\n}", "model": "NOW_LLM_llama13b_convclass_dpo_12723_nonpairwise_loss"}]
