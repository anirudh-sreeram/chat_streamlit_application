I was reading the below and am really having a hard time figuring out what I need to do.\n\nHow much can I contribute to my ESPP?\n\nIn most countries participants can contribute up to 15% of your cash compensation during each Offering Period. You may elect to authorize payroll deductions in 1% increments from a minimum of 1% to a maximum of 15% of your gross \"compensation\".  \n\nFor purposes of ServiceNow's ESPP, your \"compensation\" means all cash compensation, including without limitation base salary or regular hourly wages, bonuses, incentive compensation, commissions, overtime, shift premiums, plus draws against commissions (or in foreign jurisdictions, equivalent cash compensation).\n\nHow often can I change my payroll deductions?\n\nYou may increase or decrease the level of your payroll deductions for any subsequent Offering Period by changing your contribution amount during an ESPP open enrollment window online through your Fidelity account.\n\nOnce the ESPP open enrollment window ends, you cannot make any increases to your payroll deductions. You may make changes to decrease the level of your payroll deductions only ONCE during an active Offering Period online through your Fidelity account. Once you decrease your contribution amount during an active Offering Period, the new rate will continue for the remainder of the Offering Period, unless you withdraw from ESPP.\n\nYou may further reduce your payroll deduction percentage to zero (0) during an active Offering Period online through your Fidelity account. You may not resume making payroll deductions for the duration of the active Offering Period in which you reduce your payroll deduction to zero (0). Payroll deductions credited to you prior to the date your request is effective will be used to purchase shares on the Purchase Date; however, you may withdraw the credited amount back to you by completing the withdrawal process through your Fidelity account. If you proceed with withdrawing the credited amount, the amount will be refunded to you via your paycheck. Refunds may take 1-2 pay cycles.\n\nI really don't want any of my bonus money going to the ESPP. \n\nPlease help me out and tell me what I need to do.\n\nMarian\n\n______________\n\nProvide your output in a json, including only the names of the actions that may apply.
