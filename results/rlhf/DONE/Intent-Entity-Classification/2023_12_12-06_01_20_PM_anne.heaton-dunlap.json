[{"role": "context", "content": "Human beings appear to have been making their own ceramics for at least 26,000 years, subjecting clay and silica to intense heat to fuse and form ceramic materials. The earliest found so far were in southern central Europe and were sculpted figures, not dishes. The earliest known pottery was made by mixing animal products with clay and firing it at up to 800 \u00b0C (1,500 \u00b0F). While pottery fragments have been found up to 19,000 years old, it was not until about 10,000 years later that regular pottery became common. An early people that spread across much of Europe is named after its use of pottery: the Corded Ware culture. These early Indo-European peoples decorated their pottery by wrapping it with rope while it was still wet. When the ceramics were fired, the rope burned off but left a decorative pattern of complex grooves on the surface.\n Corded-Ware culture pottery from 2500 BC\nThe invention of the wheel eventually led to the production of smoother, more even pottery using the wheel-forming (throwing) technique, like the pottery wheel. Early ceramics were porous, absorbing water easily. It became useful for more items with the discovery of glazing techniques, which involved coating pottery with silicon, bone ash, or other materials that could melt and reform into a glassy surface, making a vessel less pervious to water.\nCourses:\n\n63CER  \u2022  LOW-TEMPERATURE CERAMIC FIRING & GLAZING TECHNIQUES Units: 4\n63CER Details\nPrerequisite: 78CER or 12CER.\nStudio practice in the glazing and firing of ceramic pieces using four low-temperature methods: electric kiln oxidation firing, luster firing, raku firing and pit firing.\n\n12CER  \u2022  BEGINNING CERAMICS POTTER'S WHEEL Units: 4\n12CER Details\nAn introduction to throwing on the potter's wheel, and its historical and contemporary significance. This course will introduce the process of wedging clay, centering a pot, pulling a wall, shaping processes, and trimming techniques to complete well balanced forms on the potter's wheel. In addition to gaining expertise in wheel-throwing, students will examine, discuss, critique and write about the techniques, tools, ceramic terminology and processes of historical and contemporary thrown clay vessels. Students will use ceramic vocabulary in verbal and written class critiques.\n\n94CER  \u2022  CERAMIC SCULPTURE Units: 4\n94CER Details\nPrerequisite: 78CER.\nStudio practice in designing and creating original ceramic sculpture.\n\n51CER  \u2022  POTTER'S WHEEL II Units: 4\n51CER Details\nPrerequisite: 12CER.\nProvides intermediate level instruction in clay processes covering intermediate wheel-throwing methods, glazing, decorating, and firing procedures. Explores technical problem solving, and creative design.\n\n88CER  \u2022  ADVANCED CERAMICS Units: 4\n88CER Details\nPrerequisite: 78CER and 12CER.\nLaboratory practice in throwing advanced forms on the potter's wheel, combining hand-built and wheel-thrown forms, glazing these forms, and understanding kiln loading and firing procedures.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Return all of the courses that involve glazing.
