Your task will be to classify the information.\nYou'll be provided with the list of intents. Each intent has its Id, consisting of 2 numbers, 2 uppercase letters and 4 lowercase letters. It may also include a field \"possible_values\" which means the slot must match one of the provided values. If multiple slots are provided, fill all the slots. If a slot is not provided, set the value of the slot to \"none\". Ignore all other slots that are not mentioned in the provided list of intents.\n\nBelow is an utterance. You should read the entirety of the utterance and determine which intent would best match the user\u2019s request. If there are multiple intents, that would match the utterance equally well, make sure to output them all. For each chosen intent, extract the slots if present and set the slot value to \"none\" if it is not present. Do not extract any other slots even if they are relevant and present in the utterance but were not mentioned in the provided list of intents.\nGive your final output as a JSON.  The JSON should always have a key \u201coutput\u201d.  If the output is not within this format, you will be heavily penalized\n\n# The utterance:\n\n\"With this letter I'd like to inform you that my package that was dispatched through the carrier \"Northern Express Inc.\" on 15.07.22  with tracking number 545MNJHIUI73473782 endured significant damage during transit. \nUpon receiving the parcel on 31.07.22 I noticed that outer box had severe dents, tears and sings of mishandling.
