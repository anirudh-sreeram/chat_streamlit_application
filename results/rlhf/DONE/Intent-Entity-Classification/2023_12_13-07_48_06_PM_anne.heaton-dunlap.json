[{"role": "context", "content": "Suggested Activities:\n\nTake the path less travelled\nFor many travelers, there is comfort in sticking to the confines of a resort or seeing only the touristy spots. But when they get home, their stories are all the same. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re traveling alone, or with a group, take the path less travelled. If you\u2019re exploring a market on your own, go left where there are less people. If you\u2019re navigating a new city with a group, ask the guide for off the beaten path recommendations for your down time.\n\nTake public transport\nThe fastest way to live like a local is to take public transport. Here you will engage with everyday people going about their everyday lives. Learn a few key phrases and strike up a conversation.\n\nStrike up a conversation\nTransform your trip from ordinary to extraordinary by striking up a conversation with the local people. I\u2019ve found this is the best way to meet people and improve my language skills.\n\nAvoid the tacky souvenirs\nDon\u2019t go for the obvious trinket to bring home when you travel. Hit the local markets and find something seriously local. When I was in Marrakech, I could have bought lots of lanterns and Aladdin style slippers from touristy shops. Instead I bought a homemade hand woven rug in a market from an old lady who had been making them all her life, which I still cherish to this day.\n\nLive like a local\nThis is my favorite thing you should do every time you travel. At least one day in each destination, live like a local \u2013 get up early and grab a cup of coffee from the local coffee shop, catch public transport, go to the supermarket and buy ingredients to make lunch, enjoy the afternoon walking around a local park, and relax in the evening by treating yourself to dinner at a locals-only restaurant.\n\nGet lost in the moment\nThe best moments I have when I travel is when I hit the back streets and get lost as I roam around aimlessly. I know I can always ask for directions or check the GPS on my phone if I start to get worried; but it\u2019s these uninhibited moments, which bring me the most amount of joy.\n\nChallenge yourself\nEat something new. Chat to someone you don\u2019t know. Don\u2019t plan every day. Ask your guide for tips only a local would know. Pack a carry on. Get off the beaten path. Go on a tough hike. Face your fears. Write a daily journal.\n\n\nRelevant Entities:\nplaces: market, markets, shops, streets, path, resort, city, supermarket, park, restaurant\nsouvenirs: lanterns, slippers, rug\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Based on the presence of the relevant entity values listed in the above context, return a YAML that contains all suggested activities where an entity value is present in its description.
