Each category is identified by an ID name, has a name and description. Additionally, the categories have a list of attributes. Each attribute is identified with an ID name, an entity name (here, entity and attribute can be used interchangeably) and a description. Some entities have a list of possible values. These values are examples and are not exhaustive. Attributes can be valid without appearing in a possible values list. Your task is to read a message and identify categories and attributes present in the message. If no category applies to the message, you should output a YAML file that simply contains Category: None. If a category applies, extract any attributes of that category present in the text. If an attribute is not present in the text, do not include any reference to that attribute in the output. \n\nOutput a YAML file. Keys should be \"CategoryX\" starting with 1. For each key, include the category ID, not the name. Also include attributes with attribute IDs as keys and extracted matches as values. \n\nClassify any categories present in the utterance and extract entities that correspond to that category, if present. Output will be in YAML format. Possible values are examples only, not a closed set. \n\nText: check status of case FHQ1738", "tags": ["complexity_type_no_intent_instructions", "complexity_type_relevant_noise", "output_YAML", "subtask_single_entity", "subtask_single_intent", "input_YAML", "input_Freeform", "prompt_complex", "num_intents_3", "response_bad_incomplete", "response_bad_instructionFollowing"]}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "Category1:\n\t 3e648eb00e824f33ac67\n   Attributes:\n\t  7f74b62a3d144dd88e1e: FHQ1738", "rejected": "Category: 3\n\tentity_name: application_id\n\tvalue: FHQ1738", "model": "NOW_LLM_llama13b_112923"}], "metadata": {"metatags": {"No Entity Instructions": false, "Complex Utterance": false, "No-Intent": "None", "Format Instructions": "None", "Complexity Tags": false, "Describe Task": "None", "Explain Slot Value definitions": false}}}
