It is important that both the correct resource and any corresponding slots are identified in the inquiry in order for the routing to be completed most efficiently.\nHere is some background.\n\nLet me present you an example. \n\n\u201cWhat cake do I make for my anniversary?\u201d\n\nOn looking at this statement, we can understand two basic things:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The person is interested in making cakes.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The occasion is an anniversary.\n\nThe former is the Intent, the latter, Entity. They more or less are the building blocks for most queries. Now, if you run a bakery, you might not just be making cakes; you might also make cookies, cupcakes, donuts and much more. In that case, you would want to add two or more Entities with the Intent of making.\nTo break it down further, let\u2019s define a few terms. \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Intent - Intention, or purpose of the user in the conversational flow.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Entity - A data point or value which you can extract from a conversation\n\nUtterances in chatbots are the inputs that the users provide to your chatbot, either through text or audio messages. Your chatbot will derive intents and entities from these utterances.\nFor the purpose of training your chatbot to derive intents and entities from your users\u2019 messages with a greater degree of accuracy, you would need to have a range of different example utterances for each and every intent.\nA chatbot will identify intents from every utterance and carry them across multiple messages so that it knows what the user wants to achieve from the conversation. An intent is basically the goal or aim that the user or customer has in mind when they are typing in their questions as utterances. The entity modifies user intent in the chatbot. Chatbots can make use of the entities that they pull from the users\u2019 utterances, slot filling different paths in the intent conversation. This allows quicker and more efficient fulfillment of the user\u2019s request.\n\u00a0\nFor this use case, resources are Intents and slots are basically Entities.\u00a0 For the following utterance, look at the list of resources and their corresponding slots to determine which ones might be applicable.\u00a0 \n\n\u201cI need to access EAP to get some online substance abuse assistance.\u201d\n\nSince this information needs to be processed for the chatbot you must adhere to a strict output format.\u00a0 \n\nI am looking for a json output that includes the following information: \n\n{\n    \"Resources\": [\n    {\n    \"resource_id\": \"<resource_id1>\",\n    \"slots\": {\n        \"<slot1_id>\": \"<slot1_value>\",\n        \"<slot2_id>\": \"<slot2_value>\"\n    }\n    }\n    ]\n    }\n\nFor the above example \u201c<>\u201d means the actual value (\u201c<slot_id>\u201d = \u201cabc123\u201d) while just having quotes means the literal value (\u201cslot_id\u201d = \u201cslot_id\u201d)\n\nSome suggested examples of slot values are in the slot descriptions, however, these are not all inclusive lists and are just examples. If there is no slot value present in the utterance for a specific slot, do not return that slot if the resource is applicable to the utterance.\n\n If no resources are determined to match, then the follow response should be returned.\n\u00a0\n{\n    \"Resources\":[\n    {\n    \"resource_id\": \"None found\",\n    \"slots\": {\n        \"None Found\": \"NULL\"\n        }\n    }\n    ]\n}\n\n", "tags": ["response_bad_incorrect", "num_intents_4", "prompt_complex", "input_Freeform", "input_JSON", "complexity_type_example_utterance_prediction", "complexity_type_no_intent_instructions", "complexity_type_slot_description_conditionals", "complexity_type_relevant_noise", "output_JSON", "subtask_single_entity", "subtask_single_intent"]}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "{\n    \"Resources\": [\n        {\n            \"resource_id\": \"109c33fec2bb477a91e\",\n            \"slots\": {\n                \"233a3bdd93064dc6a7d\": \"substance abuse\"\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}", "rejected": "{\n    \"Resources\": [\n        {\n            \"resource_id\": \"None found\",\n            \"slots\": {\n                \"None Found\": \"NULL\"\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}", "model": "NOW_LLM_llama13b_112923"}], "metadata": {"metatags": {"No Entity Instructions": true, "Complex Utterance": false, "No-Intent": "NA instructions", "Format Instructions": "None", "Complexity Tags": true, "Describe Task": "with schema", "Explain Slot Value definitions": true}}}
