[{"role": "context", "content": "Automation antidotes for the top poisons in cybersecurity management\nCyberthreats are more imminent and dangerous than ever in terms of their persistence and severity. The volume keeps growing too, with the number of breaches rising 15.1% from 2020 to 2021. The costs per breach are also increasing\u2013jumping 24.5% during the same period.\n\nA recent ThoughtLab study revealed the top cybersecurity challenges that are top-of-mind for IT leaders. This ebook will discuss how those challenges can poison your ability to protect your business, why automating security operations is the antidote, and why 80% of organizations that use automation say they can respond to vulnerabilities in a shorter timeframe. You\u2019ll understand how security automation can:\nDeliver visibility of the entire IT estate\nProvide 24/7 monitoring and drive collaboration with other IT teams\nImprove operational efficiency, reduce incident response times, and streamline processes\nEnable AI for continuous improvement\nAddress skills gaps, freeing security analysts to do more impactful and interesting work for greater job satisfaction\nDiscover how you can accelerate automation in security operations and vulnerability Management to attain a higher level of automation maturity in a short time.\n\nAvailable skills:\n\n2c6bccb4359945c8b6bdc6b208de4d7:\n  'skill description': Explains how to configure security settings to protect user\n    data and maintain privacy.\n  'attribute':\n    4d5c08f0ceff4d689c3e77a6cb6d3fa:\n      'attribute description': The data encryption standard used for VPN.\n      'attribute required values':\n      - AES\n      - DES\n      - 3DES\n      - Blowfish\n      - Twofish\n    52c25247d0354ceb84869b9c1f2811d:\n      'attribute description': The authentication method used for VPN login.\n    7e5a6dc92032462c9d8a1ddbe40aaed:\n      'attribute description': The protocol used for VPN connection.\n    fe216df4e93b48f0aa527b9b02fafa3:\n      'attribute description': The handshake protocol used for VPN connection.\n70080ca8fdea4bb3a057619d0238402:\n  'skill description': Discusses common internet speed issues and provides troubleshooting\n    steps.

For instance, a customer who types \u201cHow can I find my order status\u201d into a chat window is likely looking for, well, order status. The machine understands this intent and directs the customer to an agent or bot that can handle the query.\nIntent classification matters because correctly classifying customer intent up front leads to a much quicker and more friction-free experience for the customer (as well as any agents involved). Agent time is not wasted on poorly directed customer queries, and more importantly, customer time is not wasted.\nEfficient intent classification doesn\u2019t just figure out what the customer needs. It can go as far as determining customer sentiment and parsing when a customer is a VIP or in any other way deserving of expedited service. \nBottom line, the ability to interpret what a customer is looking for no matter how they word the request (including typos and poor grammar) is the key to solving customer problems quickly.\nFor this use case above, intent = skill.  Attributes are relevant details associated with each skill.  They help in moving the customer through a chatbot flow.  The output you provide should follow the example below.
