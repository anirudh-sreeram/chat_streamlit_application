Attributes can be retrieved for a particular skill if requested explicitly. Attributes have ID and attribute description. It can also include \"similar_values\", which mean extracted attributes can deviate from those mentioned in schema, but should be similar.\n2. your task is to find the skill from the list above that best matches the given utterance. Also extract relevant attributes for this skill.\n3. Give your final output as a JSON.  The JSON should always have a key \u201coutput\u201d.  The value of \u201coutput\u201d should be a dictionary where the key of this dictionary is the skill id and the values is a sub-dictionary where the keys are the attribute ids associated with the given skill and the values are the attribute values.  If multiple attributes are provided, fill all the attributes. If an attribute is not provided, set the value of the attribute to \"none\".\n\nExample:\nGiven the utterance \"I need battery replacement for my computer\", using the above skills you would select the <dbc1f8946380478ebb33fae > because replacing the battery falls under the description of that category.\n\n\nMy new laptop performance is very slow.
