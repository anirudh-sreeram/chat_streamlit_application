Go through the above schema of categories in Yaml format. The schema can consist of 1 to 6 categories. \nEach category has ID associated with it in alphanumeric format and category description. For each category there are also entities and their values. Entity can be retrieved for a particular category if requested explicitly. It may also include 'Example_values', which mean extracted entity can deviate from those in schema, but should be similar.\n2.

Please also retrieve all relevant entities present in the given utterance. \nIf multiple entities are provided, fill all the entities. If an entity value is not provided, set the value of the entity to \"NULL\".\n\nRespond with the best matching category for the given user input.\nImportant: the intent description must explicitly match the input provided. \nReturn your answer in YAML format:\n\noutput: \n- category: <category_id> \n  entities: \n   - <Entity_id>: <Entity1_value> \n   - <Entity_id>: <Entity2_value> \n\nIf no suitable topics are found, return:\n```yaml\ncategory:\n- id: 0bcbf21c913740908747\n  entities: []\n```", "tags": ["complexity_type_example_utterance_prediction", "complexity_type_intent_description_conditionals", "complexity_type_slot_description_conditionals", "complexity_type_relevant_noise", "complexity_type_schema_description", "complexity_type_no_intent_schema", "response_bad_ conciseness", "response_bad_instructionFollowing", "response_bad_incorrect", "input_Lists", "input_YAML", "subtask_no_intent", "subtask_no_entity", "output_YAML"]}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "category:\n- id: 0bcbf21c913740908747\n  entities: []", "rejected": "input:\n  description: The user input does not apply to any of the above\n\ncategory:\n- id: 0bcbf21c913740908747\n  entities: []", "model": "NOW_LLM_llama13b_112923"}], "metadata": {"metatags": {"Complexity Tags": false, "Format Instructions": "None", "Explain Slot Value definitions": false, "Complex Utterance": false, "No-Intent": "None", "Describe Task": "None", "No Entity Instructions": false}}}
