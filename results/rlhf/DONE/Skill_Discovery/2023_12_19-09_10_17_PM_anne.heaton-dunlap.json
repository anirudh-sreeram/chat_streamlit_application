They more or less are the building blocks for most queries. Now, if you run a gift shop, you might not just be selling flowers; you might also sell gift cards, chocolates, cakes, and much more. In that case, you would want to add two or more Entities with the Intent of buying.\nTo break it down further, let\u2019s define a few terms. \n\u2022\tIntent - Intention, or purpose of the user in the conversational flow.\n\u2022\tEntity - A data point or value which you can extract from a conversation\nUtterances in chatbots are the inputs that the users provide to your chatbot, either through text or audio messages. Your chatbot will derive intents and entities from these utterances.\nFor the purpose of training your chatbot to derive intents and entities from your users\u2019 messages with a greater degree of accuracy, you would need to have a range of different example utterances for each and every intent.\nA chatbot will identify intents from every utterance and carry them across multiple messages so that it knows what the user wants to achieve from the conversation. An intent is basically the goal or aim that the user or customer has in mind when they are typing in their questions as utterances. The entity modifies user intent in the chatbot. Chatbots can make use of the entities that they pull from the users\u2019 utterances, slot filling different paths in the intent conversation. This allows quicker and more efficient fulfillment of the user\u2019s request.\n\nFor the following, look at the list of intents and their corresponding attributes to determine which ones might be applicable.  For this use case, skills are Intents and attributes are basically Entities.  Since this information needs to be processed for the chatbot you must adhere to a strict output format.  It should be json with keys of skill with its corresponding identifier, then any corresponding attributes with their identifier and identified values nested under the applicable skill. The key names for the attribute values can be found in the attribute-description.  For this use case, attribute examples are a list of values the attribute could be but the list is not exhaustive. Other values may exist and should be identified if they are similar to those in the list.\n\nHere is the user utterance:\n\nI was trying to configure ASUS RT-AC88U but it didn\u2019t work so I ended up losing connection to VM2 and need it restored.\n", "tags": ["response_bad_incorrect", "response_bad_instructionFollowing", "num_intents_4", "prompt_complex", "subtask_multi_entity", "subtask_multi_intent", "task_combination", "output_JSON", "complexity_type_relevant_noise", "input_Freeform", "input_YAML", "complexity_type_schmea_description", "complexity_type_example_utterance_prediction"]}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "{\n    \"skill\": \"2a2a97768b9b4df5bb\",\n    \"attribute\": {\n        \"e0765c6bc3b442e3b7\": \"ASUS TR_AC88U\"\n    },\n    \"skill\": \"b93b16159911451f8c\",\n    \"attribute\": {\n        \"3a3c9714aa3f4f10bc\": \"VM2\"\n    }\n}", "rejected": "{\n    \"5186d5fa2a39429485\": {\n        \"skill-description\": \"Unintended or unauthorized disclosure of confidential or sensitive information\",\n        \"attribute\": [\n            {\n                \"attribute-description\": \"The company that experienced the data leak\",\n                \"id\": \"ecf056da07534478bd\",\n                \"value\": \"ASUS\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"attribute-description\": \"The type of data that was leaked\",\n                \"id\": \"258a76ea5e4a492983\",\n                \"value\": \"connection to VM2\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}", "model": "NOW_LLM_llama13b_convclass_dpo_12723_nonpairwise_loss", "snaprejected": "{\n \"5186d5fa2a39429485\": {\n    \"ecf056da07534478bd\": \"ASUS\",\n    \"44baa03681544aadb0\": \"Router\",\n    \"258a76ea5e4a492983\": \"connection to VM2\"\n }\n}"}]
