Each skill is the alphanumeric ID that begins each entry. Listed underneath the skill ID is a description of the skill and the attributes associated with that skill. Listed under the key 'attribute' are the attribute IDs which are also alphanumeric. For each attribute, there is a description of that attribute ID. For some of the attributes there are 'example values' which are possible values that could be found within the string. There are more values possible than are provided in the YAML list. For each skill that you identify, extract values for each attribute. If you're unable to find a value within the string, place \"Attribute Angst\" in place of the value instead. If you select 456f311fcf7a4982ae as the skill, there are no associated attributes and you can skill the attribute section of you response. \n\n## String for Analysis\n\"Start the performance improvement paperwork for Maddy Leis and send her an email notifying her of this.
