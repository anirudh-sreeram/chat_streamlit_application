Heat the oven to 350\u00b0F.\n2. Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.\n3. Prepare the pans: Coat the interior of the cake pans with a little butter, shortening, or baking spray. Make sure to get into the corners and all the way up the sides. Then, coat the interior of the pan in flour and dump out any excess. \n4. Beat the butter and sugar until fluffy, light, and creamy (about 3 to 5 minutes on medium spread)\n5. Add the eggs one at a time. Beat until the batter is very smooth.\n6. Beat in half the sifted dry ingredients (flour, salt, and baking powder)  \n7. Combine the rest of the wet ingredients (milk and vanilla) \n8. With the mixer running at low speed, alternate between adding the dry ingredients and slowly streaming in the wet ingredients until they are incorporated. \n9. Stir a few times with a spatula to make sure no more flour remains on the bottom of the bowl.\n10. Divide the batter between cake pans. Use a scale or mechanical ice cream scoop to evenly divide the batter.\n11. Smooth the tops with an offset spatula. Drop the pans against the counter to shake out air bubbles.\n12. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes: When done, the cake should be puffed like a pillow, golden, and pull away from the sides of the pan. When done, a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes should come out clean.\n13. Cool for 15 minutes in the pan. Run an offset spatula around the cake to make sure it's completely loosened from the sides of the pan.\n14. Flip the cakes out of the pans and flip right-side up to cool completely.\n15. Once cool, frost and assemble the cake with buttercream frosting.
