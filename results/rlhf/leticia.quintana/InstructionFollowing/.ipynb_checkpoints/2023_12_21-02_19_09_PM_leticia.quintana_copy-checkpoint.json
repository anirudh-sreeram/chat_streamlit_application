At the middle of the city is Central Pointe. To the west are Avenues, which go up in number as you go further west. To the east there are Streets, which go up in number as you go further east. You are standing somewhere on 3rd Avenue, which is just west of Central Pointe, when a tourist comes up to ask you a question. \nExample) 70th Street is further east than 60th Street.
