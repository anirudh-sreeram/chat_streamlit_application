The egg provided enough money for the farmer and his wife to support their daily needs. The farmer and his wife continued to be happy for a long time.\n\nBut, one day, the farmer thought, \u201cWhy should we take just one egg a day? Why can\u2019t we take them all at once and make a lot of money?\u201d The farmer told his wife his idea, and she foolishly agreed.\n\nThen, the next day, as the goose laid its golden egg, the farmer was quick with a sharp knife. He killed the goose and cut its stomach open, hoping to find all its golden eggs. But as he opened the stomach, he only found guts and blood.\n\nThe farmer quickly realized his foolish mistake and proceeded to cry over his lost resource. As the days went on, the farmer and his wife became poorer and poorer because of their foolishness."}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "Verse 1:\nOnce upon a time, in a small town,\nA farmer had a goose
