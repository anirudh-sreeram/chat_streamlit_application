It's also malleable, meaning you can shape it into different forms without breaking or cracking easily; this makes it easy to work with in jewelry making. Additionally, Gold is dense, meaning that it takes up more space than other materials per unit volume. Finally, gold is yellow due to its high concentration of iron oxide.", "rejected": "Gold is a chemical element with symbol Au (from Latin:aurum, \"gold\") and atomic number 79. It has a bright yellow color, high density, malleability, ductility, excellent reflectivity, luster, and resistance to corrosion by most elements in its environment. Gold does not have poor electrical conduction.", "model": "NOW_LLM_llama13b_111523", "snapchosen": "Gold is not a poor conductor because it has excellent thermal and electrical conductivity.
