He had been accused of impiety, which is to say failing to respect the appropriate gods of the city of Athens, and corrupting the young, which is a bit vaguer but seems to have largely involved the political implications of his philosophical ideas. According to most accounts, Socrates\u2019s actual death was delayed by a couple of weeks, during which he had the opportunity to flee the city, but he opted instead to stay and accept his punishment, ultimately ending his life by drinking hemlock tea.\n \n                You can make of his particular story what you will; to this author it\u2019s pretty unarguable that Socrates was something of a pain, and sufficiently self-righteous that he\u2019d rather die to prove a philosophical point than flee and save his own life. He literally preferred being right to being alive. The combination, along with a variety of interesting personal habits, like refusing to bathe, or change his clothes, and wandering the acropolis while accusing random people of sinfulness, didn\u2019t endear him to the average Athenian citizen. In that context, it\u2019s a bit of a surprise that only 280 of his 500 jurors chose the death penalty, while a substantial minority (220) were willing to tolerate him just on the principal that, however much of a pain he was, it really ought not to be a capital crime.\n \n                To me the interesting point though has more to do with the way the Athenian justice system worked, and, by extension, the way the entire Athenian government worked, because Athens was a very pure direct democracy. The citizens of Athens could, and did, put people to death by majority vote. They could launch a war on the same terms. They could take the property from one and give it to another, they could use public funds to build a monument, or tear one down. In point of fact the Athenians could do essentially anything by majority vote, without any underlying structural constraints. The will of the majority, as expressed via a vote, was the will of the state.\n \n                For the ancient Greek works, this was an incredibly destabilizing, and hence dangerous, political philosophy that threatened to upset the existing social order of Greece. The Greeks understood autocracies, where one human being (almost always a man in the Greek world) ruled by fiat. They also understood Oligarchies, where a group of people (again, generally men in the Greek world) ruled via some form of shared power structure, but democracy was new, it was revolutionary, and it was destabilizing.\n\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Categorize the nature of the vote the jury of Athens took from the 7 choices provided.
