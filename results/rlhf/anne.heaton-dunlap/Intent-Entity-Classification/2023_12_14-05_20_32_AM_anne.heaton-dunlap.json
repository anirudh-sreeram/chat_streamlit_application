Put together a\u00a0playlist of your favorite music\u00a0and share it with your family or friends. Have others put one together for you so you can listen to some new tunes."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Intents is an important concept in building conversational apps and refers to what a user means when he/she says something. For example, both \"yes\" and \"I want icecream\" and \"why not\" likely means that the user wants to buy an icrecream if the bot just have asked the question \"Do you want icecream?\". This highlights the fact that intents almost always are context-dependent since a Yes would mean something completely different if the bot asked \"Do you hate icecream?\" or \"Have I seen you before?\".\n\nQuite often you want to extract some information from an intent. This is where entities come in handy. For example, if you build a frit seller bot, you likely need to distinguish between the two utterances \"I want a bannana\" and \"I want an aple\". This would typically be done with an Order fruit intent which has a Fruit entity. The fruit entity would then consist of a list of fruits, with each frut possibly having synonyms.\n\nFor the \"Learn a New Craft or Hobby\" activity identify an entity and provide the one-word entity name and corresponding values in a json.", "tags": ["response_bad_formatError", "response_bad_instructionFollowing", "input_Freeform", "input_YAML", "num_intents_5", "output_JSON", "prompt_complex", "task_intent_detection", "subtask_single_entity", "complexity_type_noise", "complexity_type_adding_conditionals"]}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "{\n    \"entity\": \"hobby\",\n    \"values\": [\n        \"knitting\",\n        \"painting\",\n        \"drawing\",\n        \"clay modeling\",\n        \"dancing\"\n    ]\n}", "rejected": "{\n    \"Entity\": \"Craft or Hobby\",\n    \"Values\": {\n        \"Knitting\",\n        \"Painting\",\n        \"Drawing\",\n        \"Clay modeling\",\n        \"Dancing\"\n    }\n}", "model": "NOW_LLM_llama13b_convclass_dpo_12723_nonpairwise_loss"}]
