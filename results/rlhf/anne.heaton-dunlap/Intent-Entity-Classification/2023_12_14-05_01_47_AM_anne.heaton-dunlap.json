[{"role": "context", "content": "8469- When I travel solo, I always ask a local to share their favorite restaurants \u2013 if they want to give their secrets away! When I travel with a group, I always ask the guide to share their favorite spots to eat for me to enjoy on my down time.\n7315- The best moments I have when I travel is when I hit the back streets and get lost as I roam around aimlessly. I know I can always ask for directions or check the GPS on my phone if I start to get worried; but it\u2019s these uninhibited moments, which bring me the most amount of joy.\n6647- When I travel I often get caught up in trying to see and do as much as possible that I forget where I am. This year I\u2019ve been taking a more mindful approach to travel and have simply enjoyed being a tourist.\n5498- Don\u2019t go for the obvious trinket to bring home when you travel. Hit the local markets and find something seriously local. When I was in Marrakech, I could have bought lots of lanterns and Aladdin style slippers from touristy shops. Instead I bought a homemade hand woven rug in a market from an old lady who had been making them all her life, which I still cherish to this day.\n3486- Don\u2019t get caught up in taking photos \u2013 yes, they are wonderful keepsakes to remind you of your travels when you get home, but often travelers get so distracted taking a photo that they miss the magic moments.\n2678- At least one day in each destination, live like a local \u2013 get up early and grab a cup of coffee from the local coffee shop, catch public transport, go to the supermarket and buy ingredients to make lunch, enjoy the afternoon walking around a local park, and relax in the evening by treating yourself to dinner at a locals-only restaurant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Which of the above activities discuss tangible items you could bring home from your travels? \n\nTangible items include objects you may buy or barter for, in addition to photographs or videos you may take while traveling.
