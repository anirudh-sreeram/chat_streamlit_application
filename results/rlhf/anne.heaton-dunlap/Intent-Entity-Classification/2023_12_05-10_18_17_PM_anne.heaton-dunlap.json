On the 91st day of Personal Leave, the employee will be withdrawn from the current offering period and any contributions will be refunded via payroll. Refunds may take 1-2 pay cycles. If the employee wishes to participate in the ESPP after returning from Personal Leave, they must reenroll during the next open enrollment window.\n\nOnce the ESPP open enrollment window ends, you cannot make any increases to your payroll deductions. You may make changes to decrease the level of your payroll deductions only ONCE during an active Offering Period online through your Fidelity account. Once you decrease your contribution amount during an active Offering Period, the new rate will continue for the remainder of the Offering Period, unless you withdraw from ESPP.\n\nIn most countries participants can contribute up to 15% of your cash compensation during each Offering Period. You may elect to authorize payroll deductions in 1% increments from a minimum of 1% to a maximum of 15% of your gross \"compensation\".  \n\nYou may further reduce your payroll deduction percentage to zero (0) during an active Offering Period online through your Fidelity account. You may not resume making payroll deductions for the duration of the active Offering Period in which you reduce your payroll deduction to zero (0). Payroll deductions credited to you prior to the date your request is effective will be used to purchase shares on the Purchase Date; however, you may withdraw the credited amount back to you by completing the withdrawal process through your Fidelity account. If you proceed with withdrawing the credited amount, the amount will be refunded to you via your paycheck. Refunds may take 1-2 pay cycles.\n\nAll of the above information is context for you to make a decision about an inquiry.  Your response to the inquiry should be in YAML format.
