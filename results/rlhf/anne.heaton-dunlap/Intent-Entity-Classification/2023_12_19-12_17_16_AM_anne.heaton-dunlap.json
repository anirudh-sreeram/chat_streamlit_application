Responsibility requires a response proportional to the problem, adapting to obstacles as they arise.\n\nChatbots are conversational tools that perform routine tasks efficiently. People like them because they help them get through those tasks quickly so they can focus their attention on high-level, strategic, and engaging activities that require human capabilities that cannot be replicated by machines.\n\n"}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "", "rejected": "", "model": "NOW_LLM_llama13b_convclass_dpo_12723_nonpairwise_loss"}]
