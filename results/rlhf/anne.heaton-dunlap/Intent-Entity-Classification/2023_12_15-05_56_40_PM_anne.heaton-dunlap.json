[{"role": "context", "content": "## Building Maintenance\n### What is building maintenance?\n\nBuilding maintenance includes a wide variety of tasks depending on the particular business or organization. It encompasses a great deal of \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d work to ensure that a facility or building remains functional and comfortable for its users.\n\nBuilding maintenance includes cleaning common areas, removing trash regularly, and repairing items that are broken. It can involve inspecting, repairing, and maintaining electrical systems, heating and air conditioning systems, and other utility services.\n\nIn some cases, building maintenance extends to the outdoor property as well and includes sprinkler management, lawn care, and landscape management.\n\nA building maintenance department handles all the systems, repairs, and ongoing tasks to keep a facility running each and every day. Often, other employees of the business take much of the maintenance team\u2019s work for granted. They simply expect that the building will be kept clean, the snow will be removed in the winter, and the air conditioning will be on in the heat of the summer.\n\nAn apartment complex is one example of a business that has varying needs. Management requires regular lawn and landscape care of the property as well as cleaning and repairing units as residents move in and out. Residents themselves initiate work orders with appliance repair requests or pest control problems. Common areas also require cleaning.\n\nYou can request help for the following items:\n\nPlumbing: Report a water leak or clogged sink or toilet.\nD893: Register a guest or customer for a visit to a ServiceNow workplace.\nMail or Currier Services: Request mail or courier service.\nI942: Request additional details or report any issue with the shuttle.\nTaxi Request: Request a taxi from the office.\nP142: Request\u00a0catering\u00a0for meetings or events.\u00a0\nP094: Report a spill or a sanitation issue.\nElectrical: Report power issue (Eg. equipment not powering up, etc.)\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "So I was in the restroom and the soap dispenser ran out of soap right when I saw a mouse run across the floor.
