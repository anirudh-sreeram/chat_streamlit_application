I have already installed my email.  Now I am looking to download MS Teams so that I can start working again.\n\nI read through the instructions manual and found the following:\n\nHow to get started with Microsoft Teams (free)\nIt\u2019s easy to get started with the new Teams (free) app. The account you use to sign in to the legacy Microsoft Teams Free (classic) app can be used to sign in to the new Microsoft Teams (free) app. Even if you use the same Microsoft account both for the legacy and new versions of Teams, these are two separate tenants, and will not share any data. \n\nWindows 10 & Mac OS\nGet the latest version of Microsoft Teams on Windows 10 or macOS, and sign in using your Microsoft account. Tap on your profile picture in the top right hand corner to see the new Personal tenant appear under your account name. Switching to this tenant will switch you over to the new Microsoft Teams (free) experience. You can also open Manage accounts to see and switch to the new Teams.\n\nIf you used teams and channels in the legacy Teams (free) app to store files, you'll be able to use communities in the new Teams (free) app in much the same way. To get started, create a new community and then upload your files to the community. Files uploaded to a community will be stored in OneDrive.\n\nThe new Microsoft Teams (free) app lets you chat, schedule meetings, and so much more. Some features require a Microsoft subscription to unlock even more capabilities and remove limits. For example, meetings are capped to 60 minutes without a subscription but extended to 30 hours when you get a subscription.\n\n", "tags": ["input_Freeform", "prompt_complex", "num_intents_5", "output_JSON", "task_intent_detection", "subtask_no_intent", "subtask_OOD_intent", "response_bad_formatError", "response_bad_incorrect", "response_bad_irrelevantInformation", "complexity_type_adding_conditionals", "complexity_type_noise"]}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "{\n    \"intent_class\": \"NULL\"\n}", "rejected": "{\n    \"intent_class\": \"Teams_Outlook_Addin\",\n    \"input\": \"Switching to this tenant will switch me over to the new Microsoft Teams (free) experience.\"\n}>", "model": "NOW_LLM_llama13b_convclass_dpo_12723_nonpairwise_loss"}]
