[{"role": "context", "content": "## General information\n\nNatural Language Understanding has two important concepts:\n\nIntent: Each user utterance can be classified according to its Intent. Think of intent as a method in programming. For example, the intent of an utterance could be a Greeting (\"hello there\"), a RequestRepeat (\"could you repeat that\") or a BuyFruit (\"I want to buy an apple\"). Each intent can be expressed using many different combinations of words.\nEntity: Utterances can also contain semantic entities, that is, parts of the utterance that represent concepts such as City, Color, Time or Date. Think of entities as parameters to the method (which corresponds to the intent). Thus, the BuyFruit intent may have an entity Fruit that specifies the fruit to be bought.\n\n\n## Classification Task\n\n\nIntent Classes:\nEmail_Issues: User is experiencing some sort of issue with email, Gmail or Outlook. \nTeams_Outlook_Addin: User has an inquiry or concern with the Teams add-in button in their Outlook email such as the button is not visible.\nHow_Do_I_Install_Teams: User needs to download or install Microsoft Teams or MS Teams. They may need help with MSTeams access or setup on their phone or device. \nEmail_Setup: User is wanting to configure or set up their email, Gmail or Outlook. \n\nEntity Classes:\ndevice.type: phone, computer, laptop \napplication.name: MS Teams, Microsoft Teams, MSTeams, Teams\nemail.service: Gmail, Outlook \n\nInputs should be classified using the above criteria, identifying any intent and any entities along with their values.  If more than one class is applicable, the class where the identified entity exists should be the only class returned in the response.  If no relevant class exists, return NULL as the value for the class. All responses should be in json."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Input: issues accessing my email account. problem installing ms teams.", "tags": ["input_Freeform", "input_Markdown", "output_JSON", "response_bad_formatError", "response_bad_incorrect", "response_bad_hallucination", "response_bad_instructionFollowing", "response_bad_irrelevantInformation", "task_combination", "subtask_single_entity", "subtask_single_intent", "num_intents_4", "prompt_complex"]}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "{\n    \"intent\": \"How_Do_I_Install_Teams\",\n    \"entities\": {\n        \"application.name\": \"MS Teams\"\n    }\n}", "rejected": "{\n    \"intent\": \"Email_Issues\",\n    \"entities\": {\n        \"email.service\": \"Gmail\"\n    }\n}\n\n{\n    \"intent\": \"How_Do_I_Install_Teams\",\n    \"entities\": {}\n}\n\nThe first part of the input describes an issue with accessing an email account via Gmail - this maps to the Email_Issues intent.
