While I was on a trip my card got caught in a gas pump and tore.  I was able to still use it while traveling to charge my expenses but now the whole corner is missing and part of the magnetic strip is impacted. \n\nWhat do I do now? How can I get this fixed?\n\nI just can't not have a card.  I still have so much left of my trip.  I have to meet with clients and give several presentations that require me to be in different places, staying overnight, traveling many miles between destinations.  I also need to be able to eat.  I am at my whit's end here.\n\nHelp!\nMartha\nB2B Business Consultant - Remote\nOmaha Office\n(she, her)\n\n\nWhich of the items would you match Martha's situation to?
