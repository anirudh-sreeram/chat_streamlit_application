Let's look at each separately.\n- TIMING, for our discussion, has two functions\n- RHYTHM, like timing, has two points of interest: Individual joke rhythm and sessions rhythms.\n- THE RULE OF THREES is the third point necessary for successful joke-telling. This rule dictates that a joke's punchline must occur on the third line of the joke. If it goes beyond the third line, the joke is too wordy and too long.\n- MATERIAL is the fourth and final principle for telling good jokes. Material refers to the number of jokes in your repertoire. Analyzing your material should make you more aware of three distinctions that should put you ahead of most jokesters. It will make you more conscious of joke rhythms, and it will help you see that jokes fit particular subject categories. You will discover what categories you are strongest in and where you need additional material."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Classify the sample below, identifying the intent and any entities along with their values.
