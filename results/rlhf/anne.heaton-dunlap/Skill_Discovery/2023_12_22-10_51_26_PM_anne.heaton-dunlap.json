In essence, an intent classifier automatically analyzes texts and categorizes them into intents. It is useful to understand the intentions behind customer queries, automate processes, and gain valuable insights. We treat interactions with different UI elements in our domain as different intents. We will decide what action to perform based on the intent \u2014 clicking, typing text, etc.\nThe goal of slot filling (SF) is to identify slots corresponding to different parameters of the user\u2019s query. With the help of slot-filling models, we can understand whether each word in the query has a useful semantic meaning for us. Thus, the main challenge in the slot-filling task is to extract the target entity. Slot Filling task is similar to Named Entity Recognition (NER). Both tasks use sequence tagging as an approach. While SF aims to find entities with respect to something, NER is more generic and just looks for \u2018things\u2019 that have names, like people, companies, places, etc., but doesn\u2019t tell us what this entity refers to. We can easily redesign the model for the NER problem, but in our case, we chose SF as the one that gives more information on the output. We consider slots as UI objects that need to be interacted with, as well as various reference UI objects.\nCombining all together, we can consider the problem of IC&SF in this example \u2014 \u201cPlease press this blue Login button under the password field.\u201d For this query, the intent is \u201cpress the button,\u201d and the slots are \u201cLogin\u201d (button name) and \u201cpassword\u201d (textbox name anchor). So, intent classification focuses on predicting the query\u2019s intent, while slot filling extracts semantic concepts. Using information about the user\u2019s intent and provided slots, we can determine which action agent has to perform and which UI objects this action must be performed.\n\nGiven the process as outlined above, for this task, the term \u201cskill\u201d is equal to intent.\n\nAlso, when there is a list of values under \"Slot-Example-values\", there are either actual or like values to what is expected for that slot.\n\nRegarding the format for your response, it should be a YAML. For any skill returned, only corresponding slots with values in the inquiry should be returned.  When constructing your YAML, return only the identifier for both the skills and slots, along with the slot values.\n- skill_id1:\n   slot_id1: slot1_value\n   slot_id2: slot2_value\n- skill_id2:\n   slot_id1: slot1_value\n   slot_id2: slot2_value\n\nFor skills without an identified slot values in the inquiry, use the slot identifier '0NSNS0NS000000NS00' and set the value to \"None\".\nIf no skills are determined to match, then the following response should be returned.\n- 0aaaa0a000000aa00:\n  0NSNS0NS000000NS00: None\n\nCustomer inquiry - \nI'm currently experiencing some issues with our VPN connections that I hope you can assist me with. Recently, we've updated our VPN protocol to RSA, but since then, users have been reporting frequent disconnections. Could you please help us identify if this is a configuration issue or a compatibility problem with our systems?\nAdditionally, I'm concerned about the data encryption standard we're using, AES. We have sensitive unstructured information transmitted through the VPN, and I want to ensure it's adequately protected. Is there a more robust encryption standard you would recommend, considering our current setup and requirements? \n", "tags": ["complexity_type_relevant_noise", "complexity_type_schema_description", "response_bad_formatError", "response_bad_incorrect", "response_bad_irrelevantInformation", "response_bad_ conciseness", "subtask_multi_entity", "subtask_multi_intent", "num_intents_4", "prompt_complex", "complexity_type_no_intent_instructions", "input_Freeform", "input_HTML", "output_YAML"]}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "- 137b9a6b15af465e87f43:\n  456e2a1470de434bae59e: RSA\n  ab254627dae64f26881b7: AES\n- 5aa2c8fe03e643e5b9ef7:\n  1c87051843c54b458088d: Unstructured", "rejected": "- 0aaaa0a000000aa00:\n  0NSNS0NS000000NS00: None\n- 0000000000000000:\n  0NSNS0NS000000NS00: None\n- 0000000000000001:\n  0NSNS0NS000000NS00: None\n- 0000000000000002:\n  0NSNS0NS000000NS00: None\n- 0000000000000003:\n  0NSNS0NS000000NS00: None\n- 0000000000000004:\n  0NSNS0NS000000NS00: None\n- 0000000000000005:\n  0NSNS0NS000000NS00: None\n- 0000000000000006:\n  0NSNS0NS000000NS00: None\n- 0000000000000007:\n  0NSNS0NS000000NS00: None\n- 0000000000000008:\n  0NSNS0NS000000NS00: None\n- 0000000000000009:\n  0NS", "model": "NOW_LLM_llama13b_112923"}]
