Multiple capabilities can be returned, if applicable. If an intent is deemed to be a good match, then attributes associated with that intent should be reviewed to see if the input contains any attribute values as defined in the criteria. Not all capabilities have attributes associated with them. When looking at attributes, you may see some \u201cExamples\u201d. These examples represent the only values that could be returned for that attribute. You may also see regex patterns as \u201cExamples\u201d. If a value meets the regex criteria, it can be returned as a value for that attribute.\n\nRegarding the format for your response, it should be a YAML. For any capability returned, all corresponding attributes should also be returned with values as found in the user input. If no attribute value is found, populate the attribute value with \u201cNone found\u201d. When constructing your YAML, return the ids for both the capabilities and corresponding attributes, along with the attribute values.\n\n "}, {"role": "user", "content": "Input:\n\nAlicia Smith really helped me out last week with some important data.
