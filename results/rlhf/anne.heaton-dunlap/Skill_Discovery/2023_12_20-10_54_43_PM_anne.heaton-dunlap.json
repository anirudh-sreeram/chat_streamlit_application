Multiple intents can be returned, if applicable. If an intent is deemed to be a good match, then entities associated with that intent should be reviewed to see if the input contains any entity information as defined in the criteria.  Not all intents have entities associated with them. When looking at entities, you may see some \u201cslot-examples\u201d.  These represent the only values that could be returned for that entity.  You may also see regex patterns as \u201cpossible_values\u201d.  If a value meets the regex criteria, it can be returned as a value for that entity.  \n\nRegarding the format for your response, it should be a YAML.  For any intent returned, all corresponding entities should also be returned with values as found in the user input.  If no entity value is found, populate the entity value with \u201cNone found\u201d.  When constructing your YAML, return only the identifier for both the intents and entities, along with the entity values.  \n\nExample:\n\n- intent identifier:\n  entity identifier: entity value\n\n\nUser input:\n\nrelease 42% of VM008", "tags": ["prompt_complex", "subtask_single_intent", "subtask_multi_entity", "subtask_no_entity", "task_combination", "output_YAML", "num_intents_5", "input_JSON", "input_Freeform", "complexity_type_no_intent_in_list", "complexity_type_rule_based_slots", "response_bad_formatError", "response_bad_incorrect"]}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "- c265b26daafa42fdb63fc6e:\n  3560c64400ea4a2b914c0a4: VM008\n  769d5f404e9a4fc2b537f7c: None found\n  31b5b4ff97414fb380edd67: None found", "rejected": "- c265b26daafa42fdb63fc6e\n  resource_type: None found\n  resource_name: VM008\n  release_percentage: 42%", "model": "NOW_LLM_llama13b_112923"}]
