Multiple classes can be returned, if applicable. If a class is deemed to be a good match, then attributes associated with that class should be populated with any attribute information as defined in the above listing. Not all classes have attributes associated with them. When looking at attributes, you may see some \u201cpossible-values\u201d. This is a closed list of values that can be returned for that attribute.\nRegarding the format for your response, it should be a YAML. For any class returned, all corresponding attributes should also be returned with values as found in the user input. If no attribute value is found, populate that attribute value with \u201cNone\u201d. If no attribute is associated with a class, return the following as the attribute identifier - 0aaaa0a000000aa00 and populate that attribute value with \u201cNone\u201d. When constructing your YAML, return only the identifier for both the classes and attributes along with the attribute values, if applicable.
