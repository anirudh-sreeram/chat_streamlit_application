If the statement doesn't align with any existing intent, label it with '00000000000' intent and leave the slots/capabilities/attributes vacant. If a slot cannot be filled by the content in the statement, fill it with \"NA\". Your response should be formatted as nested YAML structures, mirroring the layout of the intent list. Please note, if an entity is nearly equivalent to a 'attribute-example' as outlined in the schema, always use the exact text from the similar value. It's crucial to consistently utilize the lengthy alphanumeric strings for both intents and attributes, abstaining from descriptive names.
