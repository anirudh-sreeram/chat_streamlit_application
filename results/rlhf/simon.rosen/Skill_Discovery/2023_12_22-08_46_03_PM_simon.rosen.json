Each intent starts with an id, and then a description, and then a list of slots, each with their own id and description. Your task is to classify an input form. You should match the input form to as many intents are applicable, and for each applicable intent you must include all attributes.

If the matched intent contains an attribute that isn't found in the input form, fill the slot with \"0\".\n\nIn your output, be sure to only include the IDs and no descriptive words other than the attributes.
