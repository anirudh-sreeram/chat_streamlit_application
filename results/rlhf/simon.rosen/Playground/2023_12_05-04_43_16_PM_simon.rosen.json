[{"role": "user", "content": "Pretend you are working to train a model on intent detection and slot filling,  related to running a store. Your job is to create a complex prompt for the model. You should chose an input format type for the model to read, a specified output format. Next you need to clarify all the possible intents, each having an intentid which is a random alphanumeric string, an intentName which is something like \"serviceRequest\". Within each intent you should identify slots, each with a slotID (random alphanumeric) and a slotName which is more descriptive. Within each slotID there should be a type and a description like this:\n\n\t- slotID: J382pm\n\t\tslotName: displaySize\n\t\ttype: Integer\n\t\tdescription: display size of the requested laptop\nNext you need create an utterance for the model to classify. \n\nNow write the prompt for the llm"}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "I am creating a prompt for a large language model that will take in natural language queries from users and return relevant information about products or services offered by a fictitious retail establishment called \"Fred's General Store.\" The goal of this prompt is to help customers find what they need quickly and easily so that they can get back to their day without hassle.\n\nThe input format I have chosen is JSON, as it provides an efficient way to structure my data while also allowing me to include additional context if needed. My expected output format is also JSON, since this makes it easy for me to parse through the results and present them in a user-friendly manner.\n\nBelow you will find a list of all possible intents along with their respective intent IDs and names. Each intent has multiple slots associated with it, which are used to capture specific details related to that particular task.\n\n```\n{\n    \"intentId\": \"J382pm\",\n    \"intentName\": \"displaySize\"\n}\n```\n\nThis indicates that the `displaySize` slot has an ID of `J382pm`, a name of `displaySize`, and is of type `Integer`. Below is an example of how this could appear within a larger JSON object representing a customer query:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"intentId\": \"J382pm\",\n    \"intentName\": \"displaySize\",\n    \"slotValues\": {\n        \"value\": \"17\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, the value `17` would be passed into the `displaySize` slot when the query is processed.\n\nHere is an example query that could be submitted by a customer:\n\n```\nWhat is the price of a 17-inch monitor?\n```\n\nBased on this query, the `displaySize` slot", "rejected": "Here's an example prompt for training an AI assistant that understands natural language queries related to managing a retail store:\n\n```\n{\n    \"input_format\": \"json\",\n    \"output_format\": \"json\"\n}\n```\n\nIntents:\n\n1. serviceRequest {\n    \"intentId\": \"d9f456\",\n    \"intentName\": \"serviceRequest\"\n  }\n\nSlots:\n\n1. requestor {\n    \"slotID\": \"J382pm\",\n    \"slotName\": \"requestor\",\n    \"type\": \"String\",\n    \"description\": \"The person making the request\"\n  }\n  \n2. department {\n    \"slotID\": \"H782p\",\n    \"slotName\": \"department\",\n    \"type\": \"Integer\",\n    \"description\": \"Department in the store where the item belongs\"\n  }\n\n3. quantity {\n    \"slotID\": \"M382pm\",\n    \"slotName\": \"quantity\",\n    \"type\": \"Integer\",\n    \"description\": \"Number of items being requested\"\n  }\n\n4. item {\n    \"slotID\": \"N382pm\",\n    \"slotName\": \"item\",\n    \"type\": \"String\",\n    \"description\": \"Item being requested\"\n  }\n\n5. displaySize {\n    \"slotID\": \"J382pm\",\n    \"slotName\": \"displaySize\",\n    \"type\": \"Integer\",\n    \"description\": \"Display size of the requested laptop\"\n  }\n\nUtterance:\n\n```\n{\n    \"intentId\": \"d9f456", "model": "NOW_LLM_llama13b_111523"}]
