[{"role": "context", "content": "\" I hope this message finds you well. However, I'm compelled to express my utmost frustration and disappointment regarding a recently purchased light bulb from your esteemed company. Unfortunately, since its installation, the bulb has consistently malfunctioned, rendering my living room practically dark.\n\nDespite following the provided instructions meticulously, the bulb refuses to turn on reliably. It flickers intermittently, providing only momentary glimpses of illumination before plunging us back into darkness. Such an inconvenience is not only disruptive but also poses safety concerns in our household.\n\nAs a loyal customer, I had expected better quality assurance standards from your renowned brand. Therefore, I respectfully request your immediate attention and assistance in resolving this matter promptly. Please arrange for a replacement light bulb to be sent to me without further delay.\n\nAdditionally, I would greatly appreciate if your team could investigate the root cause of this defect and implement stricter inspection protocols moving forward. Your commitment to product excellence and customer satisfaction will be evident in such proactive steps.\n\nTime is of the essence in addressing this issue, and I trust your capability to handle this urgently. Thank you for your attention to this critical matter.
