[{"role": "user", "content": "You are the settings on a phone that allows the phone to connect to nearby wifi. You connect to wifi that has already been saved and prompt for connections when there are some available, but the user is not currently connected to a wifi. You also respond to audio messages from the user of the phone. In the utterance below, identify which intent is being requested and identify any entities related to that intent. You may only select one intent - if more than one intent is found, select the most appropriate intent. If you are unable to determine which intent is more appropriate, select the first intent identified from the list below, from top to bottom. Only select entities from the list of entities from the intent that was identified. If you discover another entity, but it is not related to the identified intent, DO NOT include it in your response. You response should have have the identified intents in JSON format ({\"Identified Intent\": \"Intent ID\"}) and the entities identified in a bulleted list (-ID: Extracted Entity)\n\nHOME: Automatically connect to wifi\n  Entities: Location, device, wifi name\nSHARE: Show password for wifi\n  Entities: password, wifi name\nCONNECT: Connect to wifi\n  Entities: wifi name\nSECURE: Enter password for wifi\n  Entities: password, wifi name\nNONE: None of the intents apply\n\nUtterance: When I get to The Main Street Grill, I'll need to get on the wifi right away. I will need the one that's called \"MSGrillGuests\" with a password of \"MainStreet\" with a capital M and a capital S with no spaces. My phone hasn't connected to it before. \n\nWi-Fi (/\u02c8wa\u026afa\u026a/)[1][a] is a family of wireless network protocols based on the IEEE 802.11 family of standards, which are commonly used for local area networking of devices and Internet access, allowing nearby digital devices to exchange data by radio waves. These are the most widely used computer networks, used globally in home and small office networks to link devices and to provide Internet access with wireless routers and wireless access points in public places such as coffee shops, hotels, libraries, and airports to provide visitors.\n\nWi-Fi is a trademark of the Wi-Fi Alliance, which restricts the use of the term \"Wi-Fi Certified\" to products that successfully complete interoperability certification testing.[3][4][5] Non-compliant hardware is simply referred to as WLAN, and it may or may not work with \"Wi-Fi Certified\" devices. As of 2017, the Wi-Fi Alliance consisted of more than 800 companies from around the world.[6] As of 2019, over 3.05 billion Wi-Fi-enabled devices are shipped globally each year.[7]\n\nWi-Fi uses multiple parts of the IEEE 802 protocol family and is designed to work seamlessly with its wired sibling, Ethernet. Compatible devices can network through wireless access points with each other as well as with wired devices and the Internet. Different versions of Wi-Fi are specified by various IEEE 802.11 protocol standards, with different radio technologies determining radio bands, maximum ranges, and speeds that may be achieved. Wi-Fi most commonly uses the 2.4 gigahertz (120 mm) UHF and 5 gigahertz (60 mm) SHF radio bands; these bands are subdivided into multiple channels. Channels can be shared between networks, but, within range, only one transmitter can transmit on a channel at a time.\n\nExample\nInput: \n\"I can't wait to be home where I don't have to enter a password to be on the wifi!\"\nOutput: \n{\"Identified Intent\": \"HOME\"}\nEntities: \n-Location: home\n-Device: None\n-Wifi Name: None", "tags": ["task_combination", "prompt_complex", "subtask_single_entity", "subtask_single_intent", "input_JSON", "input_Lists", "input_Freeform", "complexity_type_adding_conditionals", "complexity_type_noise", "complexity_type_meta_instructions", "complexity_type_including_examples", "num_intents_5", "output_JSON", "output_Lists", "response_bad_incorrect", "response_bad_irrelevantInformation", "response_bad_instructionFollowing", "response_bad_formatError", "response_bad_ conciseness", "complexity_type_multiple_output_formats"]}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "{\"Identified Intent\": \"CONNECT\"}\nEntities: \n-Wifi Name: MSGrillGuests", "rejected": "Based on the provided information, the user wants their phone to automatically connect to a specific wifi when they are at a particular location.
