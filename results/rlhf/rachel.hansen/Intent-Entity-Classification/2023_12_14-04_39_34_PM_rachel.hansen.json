You help customers get connected with dentists and assist them with understanding their claims and coverage. You have a bulleted list of intents that you are able to assist with. Beneath each intent is a series of slots - if you identify that an intent in any customer utterance, you must fill each slot - if there is no provided information, the response is \"None.\" Do not fill slots in intents that are not identified. \n\n##Customer Interaction\nI find that I have to do this very ridiculous. I mean, shouldn't you guys just cover what you're supposed to cover without me having to do all the work? That's why insurance exists in the first place, right? This is such a scam. Especially since you don't even cover all of my procedure, and you make me pay my deductible before you'll cover a damn thing. ridiculous. Anyways, I need to submit my recent dental work for reimbursement. The cost of care was $1.857, so I've definitely met the deductible. According to you, you should owe be $1,254, but we'll see if that actually happens. Let's get this started, I don't have all day. \n\n##Further Instructions\nReview the Customer Interaction and identify the intents and slots as specified in the meta instructions. Your response should be a nested list in JSON formatting. The initial key should be the intent identified, followed by key/value pairs of the slots and the extracted information. If you produce incorrect information, you may be placing the life of the customer at risk as their needs will not be properly addressed. If you produce any text outside of the JSON formatting, you will be fired and a new bot will be hired. DO NOT PRODUCE ANY TEXT THAT IS NOT IN JSON. \n\n##Additional Information\nGalileo di Vincenzo Bonaiuti de' Galilei (15 February 1564 \u2013 8 January 1642), commonly referred to as Galileo Galilei (/\u02cc\u0261\u00e6l\u026a\u02c8le\u026ao\u028a \u02cc\u0261\u00e6l\u026a\u02c8le\u026a/ GAL-il-AY-oh GAL-il-AY, US also /\u02cc\u0261\u00e6l\u026a\u02c8li\u02d0o\u028a -/ GAL-il-EE-oh -\u2060, Italian: [\u0261ali\u02c8l\u025b\u02d0o \u0261ali\u02c8l\u025bi]) or simply Galileo, was an Italian astronomer, physicist and engineer, sometimes described as a polymath. He was born in the city of Pisa, then part of the Duchy of Florence.[3] Galileo has been called the father of observational astronomy,[4] modern-era classical physics,[5] the scientific method,[6] and modern science.[7]\n\nGalileo studied speed and velocity, gravity and free fall, the principle of relativity, inertia, projectile motion and also worked in applied science and technology, describing the properties of the pendulum and \"hydrostatic balances\". He was one of the earliest Renaissance developers of the thermoscope[8] and an the inventor of various military compasses, and used the telescope for scientific observations of celestial objects. With an improved telescope he built, he observed the stars of the Milky Way, the phases of Venus, the four largest satellites of Jupiter, Saturn's rings, lunar craters and sunspots. He also built an early microscope.\n\nGalileo's championing of Copernican heliocentrism (Earth rotating daily and revolving around the Sun) was met with opposition from within the Catholic Church and from some astronomers. The matter was investigated by the Roman Inquisition in 1615, which concluded that heliocentrism was foolish, absurd, and heretical since it contradicted biblical creationism.[9][10][11]\n\nGalileo later defended his views in Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems (1632), which appeared to attack Pope Urban VIII and thus alienated both the Pope and the Jesuits, who had both supported Galileo up until this point.[9] He was tried by the Inquisition, found \"vehemently suspect of heresy\", and forced to recant. He spent the rest of his life under house arrest.[12][13] During this time, he wrote Two New Sciences (1638), primarily concerning kinematics and the strength of materials, summarizing work he had done around forty years earlier.[14]\n", "tags": ["task_combination", "num_intents_5", "output_JSON", "prompt_complex", "response_bad_incorrect", "complexity_type_adding_conditionals", "complexity_type_noise", "complexity_type_meta_instructions", "complexity_type_including_examples", "subtask_single_entity", "subtask_single_intent", "input_Freeform", "input_Lists", "input_Markdown"]}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "{\n   \"AGEMT875\": {\n      \"Claim Number\": \"None\",\n      \"Date of Claim\": \"None\",\n      \"Status of Claim\": \"None\",\n      \"Price\": \"$1,254\"\n   }\n}", "rejected": "{\n   \"AGENT156\": {\n      \"Threats\": \"None\",\n      \"Urgent Care\": \"None\"\n   },\n   \"AGENT369\": {},\n   \"AGENT515\": {\n      \"Symptoms\": \"None\",\n      \"Pain Level\": \"None\"\n   },\n   \"AGENT689\": {\n      \"Name\": \"None\",\n      \"DOB\": \"None\",\n      \"Availability Dates\": \"None\",\n      \"Contact Info\": \"None\",\n      \"Dentist Office\": \"None\",\n      \"Claim Number\": \"None\",\n      \"Date of Claim\": \"None\",\n      \"Status of Claim\": \"None\",\n      \"Price\": \"None\"\n   }\n}", "model": "NOW_LLM_llama13b_convclass_dpo_12723_nonpairwise_loss", "snaprejected": "{\n   \"AGENT156\": {\n      \"Threats\": \"None\",\n      \"Urgent Care\": \"None\"\n   },\n   \"AGENT369\": {},\n   \"AGENT515\": {\n      \"Symptoms\": \"None\",\n      \"Pain Level\": \"None\"\n   },\n   \"AGENT689\": {\n      \"Name\": \"None\",\n      \"DOB\": \"None\",\n      \"Availability Dates\": \"None\",\n      \"Contact Info\": \"None\",\n      \"Dentist Office\": \"None\",\n      \"Claim Number\": \"None\",\n      \"Date of Claim\": \"None\",\n      \"Status of Claim\": \"None\",\n      \"Price\": \"None\"\n   }\n}"}]
