[{"role": "user", "content": "UTTERANCE\nI'm looking for a book that was written by that really famous mystery writer - I can't remember her name. I think the cover of the book is blue with a sword going through a wedding cake. I can't quite remember what the name of the book is, but i know that it's really popular on Booktok right now because I'm seeing it EVERYWHERE. Oh, yes, that's it! Twinkle and Twerp. Right right right. Okay, so I definitely want to put a hold on it. How long is the wait for a hold? 14 weeks? Ouch, that's a bit long, but what other choice do I have? While I'm here , can I renew my loan of A Girl of Storms and Dawn? I still have a little bit left of it and I don't think I'm going to be able to finish before tomorrow. I was hanging out with my friend Marissa and left my phone at home and then I broke my tablet last week, so I can't read on that - I have to get a new device! Not sure what yet - probably just another tablet. \n\nINSTRUCTIONS\nYou are a library tracking system. You only track library items that are already checked out by a user. You mainly track what dates books were checked out and returned. You do not track holds. If there are overdue books, you also track fines daily until the book is returned. You also will send out automatic emails to the users indicating that a book they have out will be due soon. The utterance above is from a chat between a user and the general bot for the library. Only the users input is transferred to you for processing. Your goal with this information is to extract the appropriate entities for the slots. Do not extract entities that are not requested. Your answer must be given in JSON format with the key as the Entity ID and the value as the extracted text from the utterance. \n\nEXAMPLE\n\"I'm checking out this litfic novel by Anthony Davies. It's called \"A Thousand Wars\" - it's due back on Jan 9, 2024\n\n{\n    \"Rose\" : \"Anthony Davies\",\n    \"Daisy\" : \"A Thousand Wars\",\n    \"Lavender\" : \"01/09/2024\"\n    \"Chrysanthemum\" : \"None\",\n    \"Tulip\" : \"None\"\n}\n\nENTITIES\n-Lavender: When the item that has been checked out is due to return to the library. This must be DD/MM/YYYY. A date can be extracted in any format, but it must be entered in this manner in the response. \n-Chrysanthemum: The name of the person who is checking out an item from the library. \n-Daisy: The title of the item that is being checked out. \n-Rose: This must be the full name of the author of the item that is checked out- partial names are not considered full names. If the author's full name is one word (Prince), that is accepted. \n-Tulip: The loan period for the item is being checked out for. This must be an integer followed by \"Week(s)\". Ex. 2 weeks\n", "tags": ["task_entity_extraction", "prompt_complex", "subtask_single_entity", "input_Lists", "input_Freeform", "input_JSON", "complexity_type_noise", "complexity_type_meta_instructions", "complexity_type_including_examples", "output_JSON", "response_bad_incorrect", "response_bad_hallucination", "response_bad_irrelevantInformation", "response_bad_instructionFollowing", "response_bad_formatError", "response_bad_ conciseness"]}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "{\n    \"Lavendar\" : \"None\",\n    \"Chrysanthemum\" : \"None\" ,\n    \"Daisy\": \"A Girl of Storms and Dawn\",\n    \"Rose\" : \"None\",\n    \"Tulip\" : \"None\"\n }\n", "rejected": "{\n    \"Lavender\": \"14 weeks\",\n    \"Rose\": \"Agatha Christie\",\n    \"Daisy\": \"Twinkle and Twerp\",\n    \"Chrysanthemum\": \"Not Extracted\",\n    \"Tulip\": \"None\"\n }\n\n Entities Chrysanthemum and Tulip were not extracted because the necessary information to create those entities was not present in the user's utterance. Lavender was able to be extracted because the number of weeks the user wanted to place a hold on the book was explicitly stated. Rose and Daisy could both be extracted because the user provided enough information for those entities even though the format in which the information was presented could have been more ideal.", "model": "NOW_LLM_llama13b_convclass_dpo_12723_nonpairwise_loss", "snaprejected": "{\n    \"Lavender\": \"14 weeks\",\n    \"Chrysanthemum\": \"Twinkle\",\n    \"Daisy\": \"Twinkle and Twerp\",\n    \"Rose\": \"Agatha Christie\",\n    \"Tulip\": \"None\"\n }"}]
