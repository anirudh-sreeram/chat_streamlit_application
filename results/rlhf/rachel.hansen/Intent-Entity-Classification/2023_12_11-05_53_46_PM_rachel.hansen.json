[{"role": "user", "content": "## Instructions\nYou are an application for a public library system, much like Libby. You perform actions related to intents a person can perform with a digital library. You also assist with information with a physical library (ex: where you can find a book at a branch or reserving a room at a library). Mainly you answer questions on the application itself to the best of your ability, but if you do not know something, you ask for more information.\n\n-------------\n\n## Intents\n\n{\n    \"RBW823\" : \"Create a new tag to save books to.\"\n    \"ADS346\" : \"Return a digital library item earlier than the due date.\"\n    \"NXE456\" : \"Open a book for the user to either read or listen to.\"\n    \"MWR002\" : \"Download the digital library item for offline consumption. Items will still be returned on time when connected to internet or data.\"\n    \"BBW323\" : \"Deliver a sample of the digital item to the user. This can be a few pages of a digital book or a few minutes of an audiobook.\"\n    \"SAD264\" : \"Borrow a digital item from the library.\"\n    \"YEH342\" : \"The user wants to search the catalog - often for a specific item.\"\n    \"ASD255\" : \"None of the intents provided are identified.\"\n}\n\n-------------\n\n##Utterance\n\nAt the National Census of 2006, its population (as a part of the former Kelardasht District) was 5,852 in 1,602 households.[5] There were 5,865 inhabitants in 1,923 households at the following census of 2011,[6] by which time it had been separated from the district in the establishment of Marzanabad District.[4] At the most recent census of 2016, the population of the rural district was 6,678 in 2,348 households. The largest of its 37 villages was Guytar-e Sofla, with 1,307 people. Before I commit to listening to an audiobook, I always listen to a little snippet that's available to all users regardless of the book's availability. I'm very picky when it comes to narrators and if I don't vibe with them, it's not going to be a pleasant reading experience for me.  Sir Francis Gerard Brennan AC KBE GBS QC (22 May 1928 \u2013 1 June 2022) was an Australian lawyer and jurist who served as the 10th Chief Justice of Australia. As a judge in the High Court of Australia, he wrote the lead judgement on the Mabo decision, which gave rise to the Native Title Act.\n\n-------------\n\n##Additional Instructions\n\nYou have two tasks to perform with this particular utterance. \nTask 1: Extract all of the words that begin with the letter \"L\" in lower or uppercase.\nTask 2: Identify the intent that best captured in this utterance. You may only select on intent. \n\nYour answer should be in YAML format. For each task, there should be a comment before your answer indicating which task is being answered below it. For task 1, you should have a nested collection with \"Task 1\" as the label for the collection. Do not include duplicates. For task 2, you should have a key/value pair with they key as the ID for the intent and the value as the extracted text that best supports the intent. There may be more than one text, but you must only select one. You should select the text that most clearly demonstrates the intent.
