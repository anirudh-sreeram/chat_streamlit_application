As discussed, I need to upgrade my wifi broadband. I would like to go up two tiers to the $129.99/month subscription plan. I would also like to update my card information from my Discover card to my Visa. My Discover is about to expire and I'm ready for that card to be closed, so I'd like to move my recurring costs to my new card from my bank. \n\nCan you remind me how I can change the name of my internet. My grandson changed it \"Grandma lives here\" and I really don't like it. I'd like it to be something more neutral - can you do that? Can I also change the names of the internet from my neighbors? I really don't like seeing those names show up on my phone - some of them are not right! I'm sure you understand. \n\nAs requested, here is my account number: 257-6954-8253\n\nPlease let me know what else you need - you can reach me at 231-359-2596 which is the phone number I originally called you from. I'm home most days and should be able to answer the phone. Though on Thursdays I sometimes go out with the girls for Bingo, but I'll get back to my messages in the evening and can give you a call back then. \n\nBest Wishes,\nJanice Everston\n", "tags": ["output_JSON", "task_combination", "subtask_multi_entity", "subtask_multi_intent", "input_JSON", "input_Lists", "input_Markdown", "input_Freeform", "input_other", "num_intents_8", "complexity_type_adding_conditionals", "complexity_type_including_examples", "complexity_type_noise", "complexity_type_meta_instructions", "response_bad_incorrect", "response_bad_hallucination", "response_bad_irrelevantInformation", "response_bad_instructionFollowing", "response_bad_formatError", "response_bad_ conciseness", "prompt_complex"]}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": " {\n    \"Detected Intents\": [\"6\", \"4\"],\n    \"Name\": \"Janice Everston\",\n    \"Email Address\": \"susanwalters@nowemail.edu\",\n    \"Phone Number\": \"231-359-2596\",\n    \"Account Number\": \"257-6954-8253\",\n    \"Payment Method\": [\"Discover\", \"Visa\"],\n    \"Mailing Address\": \"hippo\",\n    \"Billing Address\": \"hippo\"\n }", "rejected": "###Input Email\nFrom: janiceeverston@gmail.com\nTo: wifiservice@email.com\nSubject: Update Payment Info & WiFi Name Change Request\n\nHi Support Team,\n\nI hope you're doing well. I've got a few requests to handle regarding my WiFi services. Firstly, I'd like to update my payment method by switching from my current Discover card (expiring soon) to my new Visa card issued by my bank. Please assist me with updating my billing info accordingly. Additionally, could you please remind me how I can alter the name of my WiFi network? My grandson playfully renamed it to \"Grandma Lives Here,\" which I find slightly inconvenient. A more generic title would be greatly appreciated. Lastly, I often see unfamiliar devices connected to my WiFi, and I'd like to know if there's any way to identify or block specific devices by name. Your insights on this matter would be highly beneficial.\n\nFor your reference, here's my account details: Account Number - 257-6954-8253\nFeel free to contact me directly at 231-359-2596 (this is the same number I used when we spoke earlier). Although, kindly note that on Thursdays, I occasionally head out for Bingo sessions with friends; however, I always return messages in the evening and can provide a callback then. Thank you for your cooperation, and I look forward to hearing from you soon. Have a lovely day!\nWarm Regards,\nJanice Everston\n\n###Output\n{\n    \"Detected Intents\": [\n        \"6\",\n        \"8\",\n        \"4\",\n        \"3\"\n    ],\n    \"Name\":", "model": "NOW_LLM_llama13b_convclass_dpo_12723_nonpairwise_loss"}]
