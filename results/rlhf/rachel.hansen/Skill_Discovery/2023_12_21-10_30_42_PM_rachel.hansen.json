You are to only use the Intent IDs. Under each Intent ID and Description is a list of slots that pertain to that particular intent. Each slot has an attribute ID and a description of what could fill that slot. If there is 'attribute similar values' listed under description, these are examples of values that could fill the slot and are not an exhaustive list of options. \n\nFrom the given utterance, you must detect all intent IDs and fill all of the slots. Do not fill slots for intents that were not detected.
