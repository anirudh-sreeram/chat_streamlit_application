Each capability ID is the first value of letters and numbers for each capability name and description. Do not return the capability name, only return the id that is listed. For each capability that you identify, complete the slot information. Reading the user input, extract the appropriate values for each attribute listed. If a value is not found within the user utterance, fill it instead with \"The Color Purple.\" Do not fill any attributes for any capabilities that are not identified within the user input. For some attributes, there is attribute similar value - these are values that could be extracted from the user input, but this is not a complete list of example values. If you do not identify an intent within the user input, you should use the id \"Pulitzer Prize\" as your response and the slot attribute id as \"Alice Walker\" with no found utterance as the value. \n\n#User Input\nHas my office furniture expense (REP12566) been approved by my manager yet?
