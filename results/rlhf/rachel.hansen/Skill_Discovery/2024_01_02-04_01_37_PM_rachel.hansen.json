For each item, there are three keys - id, description, and slot. The id is the skill ID that you will use to identify skills within an utterance. The decription explains what the skill actually is - you will not be using this in your response. The slots are the different entities that could be found within the utterance. Each slot has a series of dictionaries with the keys as entity-id, entity-description and sometimes you'll find entity-possible-values. You'll use the entity ID in your response. The description will tell you what extracted text should be found within the utterance, but you will not use the description in your response. The entity possible values are possible extracted text values that could be found within the utterance, but are not comprehensive. \n\nYou will look at the utterance, which is a message a user has typed to you, wanting you to do something. You will review your schema for what skills might fit within this utterance. After you have reviewed the utterance and the schema, you will give your answer in YAML like this:\n\nskill id:\n  -entity id: entity value\n  -entity id2: entity value2\n\nIf you analyze the utterance, select the skill, but are unable to find an entity for the slot, place \"No Entity Discovered\" there instead.
