A primordial being sits at what will one day be the center of the universe but for now, it is all there is. As the first few seconds of existence passes, the lack of anything other than itself sets in for the being. It decides to pull something from nothing to pass the dawning eternity. It has already sated a budding hunger by creating an apple and created something metal to toy with to pass the time. Its next desire takes time to form in its head. It wants something not material, something hard for it to describe. After a couple eons of thinking, it eventually figures out what it desires. It desires something to feel past nothing. It decides to create a sensation. \n\nPart 1)\nWhich intents is the above utterance not looking for?\n\nPart 2)\nThen pretend to think like the being and chose a sensation type and intensity to experience.

For this example, we will say it desires to experience happiness and does so with major intensity.

Since it started off by experiencing happiness upon creating the world, it might want to try something different this time around.
