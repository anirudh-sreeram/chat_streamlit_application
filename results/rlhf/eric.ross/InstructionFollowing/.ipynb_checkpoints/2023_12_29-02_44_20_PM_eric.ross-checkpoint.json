A top speed of 18 knots (33 km/h; 21 mph) made her one of the fastest battleships in the world. Bouvet spent the majority of her peacetime career conducting routine training exercises and was withdrawn from front-line service in 1907. In early 1915 during World War I the ship participated in a series of attacks on the Ottoman fortifications guarding the Dardanelles. On 18 March 1915, during a major assault, the vessel was hit approximately eight times by shellfire but was not seriously damaged. While turning to withdraw, she struck a mine and sank within two minutes; only 75 men were rescued from a complement of 718. Two British battleships were also sunk by mines the same day, and the disaster convinced the Allies to abandon the naval campaign in favor of an amphibious assault on the Gallipoli Peninsula.\"", "tags": ["instrwants_length", "instrformat_Lists", "instrwantsformat_Lists", "outbad_instr_leak", "outbad_instr_format", "instrwantstask_entityExtraction", "instrtotalturnnumber_3", "uttr_context", "outbad_general_irrelevant"]}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "Here is the list of armaments that the battleship Bouvet had:\n- Two 305 mm (12 in) guns\n- Two 274 mm (10.8 in) guns\nGoodbye, have a nice day!", "rejected": "The armaments of the battleship Bouvet included two 305 mm (12 in) guns and two 274 mm (10.8 in) guns.
