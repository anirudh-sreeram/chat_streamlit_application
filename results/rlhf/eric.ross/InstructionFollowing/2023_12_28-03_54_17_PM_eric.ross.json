They began with the Crusades to the Holy Land (1095\u20131291); the immediate cause was the Byzantine\u2013Seljuk wars (1048\u20131308), an ongoing conflict over Anatolia, and in 1095 the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos requested military aid from Pope Urban II; Urban II responded by calling for war against the Seljuk Turks in the Holy Land.\n\nThe Seljuks held Jerusalem, from 1073\u20131098; before that it had been held by the Byzantines (to 638) and the Caliphates. After that, Jerusalem was held by the Fatimid Caliphate (1098\u20131099); Crusaders (1099\u20131187); the Ayyubid Sultanate (of Saladin), Christians and Khwarezmian Tatars (at various times between 1187 and 1260); the Mamluk Sultanate (1260\u20131517); the Ottoman Empire (1517\u20131917).\n\nThere were nine numbered Crusades to the Holy Land, but there were many additional ones to the Holy Land. Important Crusades to the Holy Land included:\n\nFirst Crusade (1095\u20131099) resulted in the conquest of Jerusalem and the Holy Land. It was preceded by the People's Crusade (1096, a popular crusade), and followed by the Crusade of 1101 (Crusade of the Faint-Hearted), which were both Turkish victories.\nCrusader states were then established, and included the Kingdom of Jerusalem, the Principality of Antioch, the County of Tripoli and the County of Edessa. Nicaea and much of western Anatolia was also restored to the Byzantine Empire.\n\nVenetian Crusade (1122\u201324), in which the Republic of Venice succeeded in capturing Tyre.\nSecond Crusade (1147\u20131149) was a failed attempt to reclaim of Edessa after its fall in 1144.\nIn the first Fall of Jerusalem (1187), Jerusalem was retaken by Muslims led by Saladin of the Ayyubid Sultanate.\n\nThird Crusade (1189\u20131192) included as crusaders Philip II of France, Richard I of England, and the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. It failed to retake Jerusalem, but a treaty provided that unarmed Christian pilgrims and traders could visit Jerusalem. Crusader territories were reclaimed, including the key towns of Acre and Jaffa; the crusader state of the Kingdom of Cyprus was established.\nCrusade of 1197, of Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor, resulted in the capture Beirut and Sidon from the Muslims in 1198.\nFourth Crusade (1202\u20131204) primarily resulted in the Sack of Constantinople (1204) by crusaders and the Republic of Venice. The Catholic city of Zara was also sacked by crusaders. The Latin Empire of Constantinople was then established as a crusader state.\nFifth Crusade (1217\u20131221) was an unsuccessful attempt to conquer the powerful Ayyubid state in Egypt, to later regain Jerusalem.\nSixth Crusade (1228\u20131229) resulted in a diplomatic crusader victory, who gained control of Jerusalem between 1229 and 1244.\nJerusalem reverted to Christian control in 1229.\n\nBarons' Crusade (1239\u20131241) enlarged the territory controlled by the crusaders, and was in territorial terms the most successful crusade since the First.\nIn the second Fall of Jerusalem (1244), the Khwarazmians, whose empire had been destroyed by the Mongols, destroyed much of the city.\n\nSeventh Crusade (1248\u20131254) aimed to reclaim the Holy Land by attacking Egypt; Louis IX of France was defeated in Egypt by an Ayyubid and Bahriyya Mamluk army.\nEighth Crusade (1270) was another crusade of Louis IX of France against the city of Tunis in Tunisia. Louis IX died, and the crusade was inconclusive.\nNinth Crusade (1271\u20131272), or Lord Edward's crusade, was a crusade of King Edward I of England to the Holy Land, then held mostly by the Mamluk Sultanate. It was partly successful, but failed to conquer Jerusalem.\nThe fall of Acre in 1291 ended the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem, and by 1302 a permanent crusader presence in the Holy Land had ended."}, {"role": "user", "content": "When did the first crusade start and then end?", "tags": ["instr_context", "outformat_Freeform", "outbad_instr_general", "outbad_general_irrelevant", "outbad_instr_other", "uttrwants_example", "totalturnnumber_3", "instrtotalturnnumber_3", "instrwantspersona_descriptive", "instrwantstask_closedQA", "instrwantsrule_topicGuardrail"]}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "The first crusade started in 1095, and ended in 1099.
