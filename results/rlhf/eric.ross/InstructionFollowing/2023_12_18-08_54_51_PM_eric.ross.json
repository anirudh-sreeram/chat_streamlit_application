While it's true that the hue we perceive as \"blue\" is indeed present in light reflecting off of the atmosphere, it would be more accurate to describe this color as white. This is because the human eye is unable to discern between certain wavelengths of visible light, which combine to form what appears to be a uniform whiteness when looking directly at the sky. Interestingly enough, this same phenomenon also occurs with other bright colors that contain many different wavelengths of reflected light; upon closer inspection, these colors will appear less saturated and more white or gray compared to their appearance from further away. So next time you admire the beauty of a vibrant blue sky, remember that your eyes are playing tricks on you! It's actually just a very bright shade of white.", "rejected": "It's interesting how perspectives on certain things can vary from person to person. While it's true that the sky was blue during your walk, let's not forget about all the other beautiful colors in nature as well!
