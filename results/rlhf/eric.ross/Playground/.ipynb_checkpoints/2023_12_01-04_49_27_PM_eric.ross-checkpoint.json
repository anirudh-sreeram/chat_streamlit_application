The material resources are finite, and significant amounts of matter are neither lost nor gained across the boundary between atmosphere and space. Our planet is essentially a closed system with respect to matter but an open one so far as energy is concerned (Phillipson 1975). Radiant energy from the sun enters the biosphere and is re-radiated to space as heat. The maintenance of global stability requires that the biospheric inputs and outputs of energy equal each other over time; if this equality is severely disrupted then unstable conditions will persist until the changed amounts of input and output equalize and a new equilibrium is achieved.\n\nGlobal warming is a clear indication of unstable, non-equilibrium conditions. A new equilibrium will eventually be reached but the question is whether, when it is reached, will conditions be suitable for human existence and well being.\n\nThe biosphere provides the scale on which global conservation strategies and management operations function. The natural resources of the biosphere are, in effect, assets; as such they can be categorized as either fixed or current. The fixed assets are the non-living (abiotic) components, exemplified by gases (the atmosphere), water bodies (the hydrosphere), and solid inorganic matter (the lithosphere); together these constitute the physico-chemical environment. The current assets are the living (biotic) components\u2014a potentially renewable stock of plants (flora) and animals (fauna). Transfers within and between the two major types of asset can, and do, take place; for example, the daily exchanges of heat energy between atmosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere and also the biological processes of photosynthesis and decomposition which involve energy transformations and exchange of chemical elements between abiotic and biotic parts of the biosphere.\n\nThe virtually closed biosphere is clearly a mosaic of many interacting smaller systems in which the sum of the parts is more stable than any one of the constituent parts. Biospheric stability and local ecosystem stabilities are inextricably linked; on these grounds alone a strong case can be made for protecting the Earth's natural ability to regulate its own stability by maintaining habitat diversity. Management of the biosphere's present habitat diversity and natural resources is multinational. In 1973 it was estimated that 174 nations each had a share of global assets, which included 1841 thousand million metric tonnes dry mass of plant material (Phillipson 1973).\n\nOn a smaller local or regional scale every ecosystem\u2014be it on land or in the ocean\u2014is, like the biosphere, a functioning system. Unlike the biosphere, however, significant amounts of matter can be lost or gained across boundaries (which are frequently difficult to define). Ecosystems smaller than the biosphere are essentially open systems with respect to matter as well as energy. Left unperturbed over ecological or evolutionary time the constituent ecosystems of the biosphere will, as a result of interactions between organisms and environment, also reach a state of equilibrium; classical examples of this are mature tropical forests and well-established coral reefs. Because of the dynamic nature of the interactions between living and non-living components, ecosystems smaller than the biosphere rarely achieve a fixed and lasting equilibrium, and instead exhibit varying degrees of fluctuation (Phillipson 1989a).\n\nCommitment to conservation, including sustainable development objectives, appears to be strongest when:\n\nan influential leader declares it should be so;\nnon-government agencies actively promote conservation;\nlocal people become involved in conservation projects;\nlocal people benefit either financially or in kind as a result of conservation activities;\nthe country itself makes a substantial contribution in cash or kind to conservation."}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "This text discusses the importance of conserving the biosphere and local ecosystems for maintaining global stability and human well-being.

On a global scale, our planet operates as a closed system regarding matter but an open one when it comes to energy. The biosphere plays a crucial role in maintaining global stability by balancing inputs and outputs of energy. Global warming indicates instability and a need for equilibrium. The biosphere has both fixed assets, such as abiotic components, and current assets, which include living organisms. Local ecosystems, while similar to the biosphere, differ in their openness regarding matter and energy exchange. Achieving and maintaining equilibria in these systems is challenging due to dynamic interactions between living and non-living components. Effective commitments to conservation arise when leaders support it, NGOs promote it, locals participate, there are benefits, and the country contributes significantly.", "model": "NOW_LLM_llama13b_112923", "snapchosen": "This text discusses the importance of conserving the biosphere and local ecosystems for maintaining global stability and human well-being.
