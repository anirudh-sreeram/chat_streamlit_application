As usual, the weather was beautiful but it's never not weird to be wearing shorts in December. Or to come back home and hear the AC running. Guess one of the nice things about weather that's consistent year-round is that it makes going anywhere that has any amount of variation in temperature special by virtue of finally being something different. Of course, thinking about that just gets me daydreaming about a vacation. Not the best for productivity, huh?
