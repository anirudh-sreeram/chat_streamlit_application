Thus, blue light is also not the correct choice.\nUltraviolet light has wavelengths shorter than those of visible light, so it does not appear on the visible light spectrum. It is also not detectable by human eyes. This makes ultraviolet light the correct answer.\nThe correct option is 3. Ultraviolet light.", "rejected": "Far-red light is a type of low-energy photon that can be detected by some animals, such as insects and birds, but it's not part of the traditional visual spectrum that humans perceive. \nBlue light, which has a shorter wavelength than other types of visible light, is a form of high-energy visible (HEV) light that's known for its ability to affect circadian rhythms and sleep patterns in humans.\nUltraviolet light is an electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength shorter than visible light, so it's not part of the visible spectrum that humans can see. It's often categorized based on its wavelength: UVA, UVB, and UVC.\nTherefore, the correct answer would be far-red light.", "model": "NOW_LLM_llama13b_110723", "snapchosen": "Far-red light is a type of light that is beyond the red end of the visible light spectrum, but it is still within the range of human visibility.
