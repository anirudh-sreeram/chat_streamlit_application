Playing cards even competed with devotional images as the most common uses for woodcuts in this period. Most early woodcuts of all types were coloured after printing, either by hand or, from about 1450 onwards, stencils. These 15th-century playing cards were probably painted. The Flemish Hunting Deck, held by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, is the oldest complete set of ordinary playing cards made in Europe from the 15th century.[66]\n\nAs cards spread from Italy to Germanic countries, the Latin suits were replaced with the suits of leaves (or shields), hearts (or roses), bells, and acorns. France initially used Latin-suited cards and the Aluette pack used today in western France may be a relic of that time, but around 1480, French card manufacturers, perhaps in order to facilitate mass production, went over to very much simplified versions of the German suit symbols. A combination of Latin and Germanic suit pictures and names resulted in the French suits of tr\u00e8fles (clovers), carreaux (tiles), c\u0153urs (hearts), and piques (pikes) around 1480. The tr\u00e8fle (clover) was probably derived from the acorn and the pique (pike) from the leaf of the German suits. The names pique and spade, however, may have derived from the sword (spade) of the Italian suits.[67] In England, the French suits were eventually used, although the earliest packs circulating may have had Latin suits.[68] This may account for why the English called the clovers \"clubs\" and the pikes \"spades\".\n\nIn the late 14th century, Europeans changed the Mamluk court cards to represent European royalty and attendants. In a description from 1377, the earliest courts were originally a seated \"king\", an upper marshal that held his suit symbol up, and a lower marshal that held it down.[69][70] The latter two correspond with the Ober and Unter cards still found today in German and Swiss playing cards. The Italians and Iberians replaced the Ober/Unter system with the \"Knight\" and \"Fante\" or \"Sota\" before 1390, perhaps to make the cards more visually distinguishable.\n\nIn England, the lowest court card was called the \"knave\" which originally meant male child (compare German Knabe), so in this context the character could represent the \"prince\", son to the king and queen; the meaning servant developed later.[71][72] Queens appeared sporadically in packs as early as 1377, especially in Germany. Although the Germans abandoned the queen before the 1500s, the French permanently picked it up and placed it under the king. Packs of 56 cards containing in each suit a king, queen, knight, and knave (as in tarot) were once common in the 15th century.\n\nIn 1628, the Mistery of Makers of Playing Cards of the City of London (now the Worshipful Company of Makers of Playing Cards) was incorporated under a royal charter by Charles I; the Company received livery status from the Court of Aldermen of the City of London in 1792.[73] The Company still exists today, having expanded its member ranks to include \"card makers... card collectors, dealers, bridge players, [and] magicians\".[74]"}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "- Berne\n- Florence\n- Paris\n- Ulm\n- Nuremberg\n- Augsburg\n- London", "rejected": "- Berne\n- Florence\n- Paris\n- Ulm\n- Nuremberg\n- Augsburg\n- 15th Century\n- Charles VI of France\n- 1418 - 1450\n- 1379\n- 1392 - 1393\n- 1480\n- 15th Century\n- 1628\n- Charles I\n- London\n- Royal Charter\n- Court of Alderman\n- 1792\n- Worshipful Company of Makers of Playing Cards", "model": "NOW_LLM_llama13b_111523", "snapchosen": "- Berne\n- Florence\n- Paris\n- Ulm\n- Nuremberg\n- Augsburg\n- London", "snaprejected": "- Berne\n- Florence\n- Paris\n- Ulm\n- Nuremberg\n- Augsburg\n- 15th Century\n- Charles VI of France\n- 1418 - 1450\n- 1379\n- 1392 - 1393\n- 1480\n- 15th Century\n- 1628\n- Charles I\n- London\n- Royal Charter\n- Court of Alderman\n- 1792\n- Worshipful Company of Makers of Playing Cards"}]
