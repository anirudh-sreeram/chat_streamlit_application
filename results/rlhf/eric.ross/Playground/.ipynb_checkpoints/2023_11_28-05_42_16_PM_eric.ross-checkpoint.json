Despite it being midday on a weekday, I find the place surprisingly packed. The AC is broken so by the time I reach the soda in the back, my shirt is clinging to me from sweat. Opening the refrigerator door to retrieve the can of soda is a welcome but brief reprieve from the heat. I skip out on the chocolate bar, figuring it'll be melted by the time I walk home. Fortunately, the random midday rush of people is mostly gone by the time I get in line to pay and before I know it, I'm out the door and on my way home."}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "The convenience store was unexpectedly busy, even though it was mid-morning on a weekday.
