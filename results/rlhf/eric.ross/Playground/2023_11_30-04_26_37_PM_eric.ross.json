With its conclusion, many of the serious difficulties that the young republic had faced since the Revolution disappeared. National union under the Constitution brought a balance between liberty and order. With a low national debt and a continent awaiting exploration, the prospect of peace, prosperity, and social progress opened before the nation.\n\nCommerce cemented national unity. The privations of war convinced many of the importance of protecting the manufacturers of America until they could stand alone against foreign competition. Economic independence, many argued, was as essential as political independence. To foster self-sufficiency, congressional leaders Henry Clay of Kentucky and John C. Calhoun of South Carolina urged a policy of protectionism\u2014imposition of restrictions on imported goods to foster the development of American industry.\n\nThe time was propitious for raising the customs tariff. The shepherds of Vermont and Ohio wanted protection against an influx of English wool. In Kentucky, a new industry of weaving local hemp into cotton bagging was threatened by the Scottish bagging industry. Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, already a flourishing center of iron smelting, was eager to challenge British and Swedish iron suppliers. The tariff enacted in 1816 imposed duties high enough to give manufacturers real protection.\n\nIn addition, Westerners advocated a national system of roads and canals to link them with Eastern cities and ports, and to open frontier lands for settlement. However, they were unsuccessful in pressing their demands for a federal role in internal improvement because of opposition from New England and the South. Roads and canals remained the province of the states until the passage of the Federal Aid Road Act of 1916.\n\nThe position of the federal government at this time was greatly strengthened by several Supreme Court decisions. A committed Federalist, John Marshall of Virginia, became chief justice in 1801 and held office until his death in 1835. The court\u2014weak before his administration\u2014was transformed into a powerful tribunal, occupying a position co-equal to the Congress and the president. In a succession of historic decisions, Marshall established the power of the Supreme Court and strengthened the national government.\n\n"}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "Here are the last names from the text listed in reverse alphabetical order:\n\n- Calhoun\n- Clay\n- Marshall\n- War\n- York", "rejected": "Here are the last names listed in reverse alphabetical order:\n\n- Calhoun\n- Clay\n- Marshall\n- York\n- Adams\n- Kenton\n- Lincoln\n- Monroe\n- Jefferson\n- Madison\n- Washington\n- Hamilton\n- Franklin\n- Wilson\n- Jackson\n- Polk\n- Taylor\n- Pierce\n- Buchanan\n- Grant\n- Hayes\n- Garfield\n- Arthur\n- Cleveland\n- McKinley\n- Roosevelt\n- Taft\n- Wilson\n- Harding\n- Coolidge\n- Hoover\n- F.
