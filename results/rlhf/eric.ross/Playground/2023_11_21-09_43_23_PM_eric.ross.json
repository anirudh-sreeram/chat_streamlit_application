The gods An and Enlil are invoked and it is explained that they have invested Lipit-Ishtar as \"the country\u2019s prince\" in order to \"establish justice in the land, eradicate the cry for justice [...] [and] forcefully restrain crime and violence\" so \"that Sumer and Akkad [can] be happy\".[4] The prologue further informs the reader that Lipit-Ishtar has recently freed slaves from Nippur, Ur, and Isin.[4]\n\nThe academic Martha Roth summarizes the prologue as containing self-praise of Lipit-Ishtar, listing all Lower Mesopotamian cities under his rule, and emphasizing his success as a restorer of justice.[5]\n\nLaws\nThe existing main body consists of almost fifty legal provisions.[4] The first set of them deals with boats. They are followed by provisions on agriculture, fugitive slaves, false testimony, foster care, apprenticeship, marriage and sexual relationships as well as rented oxen.[6] The provisions are all introduced by the Sumerian tukun-be, meaning \"if\".[6][7] The transmitted provisions do not contain crimes which are punished by death.[7]\n\nThe code contains, for example, a provision according to which false accusers have to bear the punishment for the crimes they have alleged.[4][7] All extant provisions of the code are listed by Martha Roth[8] and Claus Wilcke [de].[9]\n\nEpilogue\nThe epilogue of the code contains three large lacunae.[4] The remaining parts explain that Lipit-Ishtar executed a divine order and brought justice to his land:[4]\n\nI, Lipit-Ishtar [\u2026] silenced crime and violence, made tears, laments and cries for justice taboo, let probity and law shine, made Sumer and Akkad content.\n\n\u2014\u200aLipit-Ishtar (translated by Claus Wilcke)\nFurthermore, the erection of the stele is reported upon, and blessings are said to those who honour the stele and curses inflicted upon those who would venture to desecrate or destroy it.[4][6]\n\nSummarize the above text."}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "The Code of Lipit-Ishtar is an ancient law code from ancient Mesopotamia.
