Kindly review the document to confirm whether mortgage insurance has been activated for the relevant loans.\nIf you regularly receive this report, you may observe that the borrowers' personal identifiable information has been removed. This step has been taken as part of our continuous efforts to ensure the security of your borrowers' data.\n\nNote: For Accucert customers, loans can still be activated using that process.\nBecause there is consumer data in this file, it is protected with a password in order to comply with our Privacy Policies. A second email containing the password will be sent to you.\n\nDirections:\n\n* Select the applicable \"\"Action\"\" for each loan in the open agreement record\n\"\"Action\"\" definitions:\n1. Activate = Mortgage insurance needed since zero monthly loan has closed (Loan closing date should be given)\n2. Cancel = Mortgage insurance not needed.\n3. Unknown = Could not find loan in our system, etc.\n4. Pending = Loan not closed or unknown status. No action needed at this time.\no If Activate is selected, a loan closing date must be provided (mm/dd/yy) (Zero monthly only)\no If Cancel, Pending or Unknown is selected, do not provide a loan closing date\no If incorrect Lender Loan Number, supply the correct number\no If any other data is incorrect, kindly reach out to Customer Support at 800-436-5624.\n\nNote: If activate is selected and no date is given, the message, \"\"Date is Required\"\" will appear alongside that loan.\n\n* For the fastest response time, e-mail the completed record to SalesPushActionLink@edicta.com<mailto:SalesPushActionLink.edicta.com>.
