In other words, we should write the second number repeatedly until we reach the desired multiplication result. So, in your case, writing \"125\" two times gives us \"250\", which means that 4 multiplied by 125 is equal to 250 (4x1 = 4, 4x250 = 250). The answer could be also achieved through traditional multiplication: 4 x 125 = 500, then subtracting 250 from both sides yields 500 - 250 = 250, hence leading us to the same result. This method of calculating multiplications might not always work for large integers, but it's a good mental math exercise for small numbers and can serve as a helpful mnemonic device for remembering how to perform basic multiplications.", "rejected": "According to the provided explanation, 4 can be thought of as a single-digit number, while 125 can be broken down into 25 (which can be thought of as 5 times 5) and 2 (which can be thought of as 2 times 2). Using this method, we can multiply these two numbers together by simply adding the first number (4) as many times as the second number (25) when written out in its component parts (i.e., 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20; 20 + 20 + 20 = 60; 60 + 60 = 120; 120 + 120 = 240; 240 + 240 = 480). Therefore, 4 * 125 would equal 480 because both numbers multiplied together using this method yield an answer of 480.", "model": "NOW_LLM_llama13b_convclass_dpo_12723_nonpairwise_loss"}]
