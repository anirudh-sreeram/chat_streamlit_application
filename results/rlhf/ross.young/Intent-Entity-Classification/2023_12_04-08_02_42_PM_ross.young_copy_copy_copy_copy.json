First, you should read the above table to become familiar with a subset of typical banking transactions defined by reading the descriptions associated with each.  Each transaction also has an example provided that specifies a viable utterance that would be classified into that given intent class.  Each intent will also have a unique ID associated with it that starts with an upper case letter, 1 number, and 2 underscores. For each transaction type there are also slots associated with them. Slots are values that need to be retrieved for a particular transaction. Each slot will have a name and an example of what a value looks like. If multiple slots are provided, fill all the slots. If a slot is not provided, set the value of the slot to N/A. Below is an utterance.  You should read the entirety of the utterance and determine which transaction type would best match the user\u2019s request.  If there are multiple transactions that would match the utterance equally well, make sure to output all. For each chosen transaction, extract the slots and their values if present and set the slot value to N/A if it is not present. Give your final output as a JSON.  The JSON should always have a key \u201coutput\u201d.  The value of \u201coutput\u201d should be a dictionary where the key of this dictionary is the transaction id and the values is a subdictionary where the keys are the slot ids associated with the given transaction and the values are the slot values.  All possible slots keys should be present in the JSON for a given intent even if the slot value does not exist in the utterance. If monetary values are presented in words, output them as numerical characters. When extracting the monetary value, DO NOT include the dollar sign.\n\n### UTTERANCE \nGood morning. I will need to withdraw $200 from account 3213 331 934 and I would like that in $10 denominations. Next, I need to deposit a cheque in the amount of three hundred and seventy dollars and twenty two cents to my chequing account ending in 8411.
