They paid $5.99 and indicated that they cannot afford to waste money due to the current state of the economy. The main concern is that the potatoes were rotten upon purchase, which led them to request a refund.", "model": "NOW_LLM_llama13b_convclass_dpo_12723_nonpairwise_loss", "snaprejected": "Here is a summary of the data presented in the customer complaint using entities and attributes:\n\nTable: Customer Complaint Summary\n\n|Entity Type | Entity Name | Attribute| Value|\n|--|--|--|--|\n|Date| Purchase Date| |May 15th|\n|Location| Store Location| |Saint Bruno|\n|Product| Rotten Potatoes| |5lb Bag|\n|Price| Cost of Product| $5.99|\n|Customer Request| Refund Requested| Yes|\n\nUsing the information provided in the customer complaint we are able to deduce that the customer visited a specific store location on a specific date and purchased a 5 lb bag of potatoes which they claim are rotten. The customer requests a refund for the spoiled product and expresses dissatisfaction with the quality due to the current economic climate. We are not able to determine the PLU or SKU number from this information. However, by assigning the appropriate entities and attributes we have extracted all relevant information from the customer complaint. This information could then be used to appropriately address the customer's concern and initiate the refund process.", "snapchosen": "Here is a breakdown of the information provided by the customer complaint using the assigned entity types:\n\n|Entity Type|Entity Value|\n|--|--|\n|Date & Time Purchased|Saturday, May 15th|\n|Location Purchased|Saint Bruno|\n|Product Name|Potatoes|\n|Quantity Purchased|5lb Bag|\n|Price Paid|$5.99|\n|Issue Description|Rotten Potatoes|\n\nFrom the information provided, we can determine that the customer bought some potatoes from us that they claim are rotten. They are requesting a refund for the $5.99 they spent on the product. Based on the date and time the purchase occurred, along with where it happened, we should have no issue locating the correct purchase in question. The only potential issue would be if the customer does not have their receipt, which they may need to provide in order to receive a refund. Without the specific item code or name listed, it may also prove difficult to locate the exact potato variety the customer purchased without further description. However, based on the quantity purchased, it seems unlikely that the entire bag would be spoiled unless it had been exposed to some form of external contamination during handling or transportation prior to sale. This is something that will need to be investigated to ensure the quality of our products moving forward."}]
