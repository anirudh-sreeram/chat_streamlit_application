We can help you with both of those things today. To start, let's remove any data they might have on their line so it doesn't carry over into the next billing cycle. What slot value do you wish to associate with the data amount slot entity?\" \nCustomer: \"Two gigabytes\"\nRepresentative: \"Great! Since two gigabytes is already an established entity value in our system, I can apply it to the correct slot with one click. I just need to confirm your intent by having you say 'remove two gigabytes of data from [entity/slot_value]'. Is that correct?\"\nCustomer: \"Yes, that's what I meant.\"\nRepresentative: \"Okay, great! I have successfully removed two gigabyte of data from your daughter's line. Now we just need to disconnect her from the plan itself. Are you sure you want to move forward with this step?\"\nCustomer: \"Yes, that's why I called.\"\nRepresentative: \"Alright, I will go ahead and begin that process now.
