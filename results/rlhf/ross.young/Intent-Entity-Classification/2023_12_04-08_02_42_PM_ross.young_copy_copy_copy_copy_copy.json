Let's handle each part of this request accordingly. Firstly, you mentioned having an automatic payment which typically indicates a bill payment or invoice settlement through your savings account. To stop this payment, we will require details such as the payment's reference number or description, the payee name, and the amount being paid out. Please provide these details so that I may assist you effectively in stopping any further transactions. Secondly, regarding the check deposit, you indicated the check is worth $233 and is from an account ending in 34143; however, checks do not usually have a specific \"account ending.\" Instead, they often include the routing information for the issuing bank along with the account number. Would you mind providing me the full routing information for the check you intend to deposit? Once I have both of these details, I can process them according to your instructions.
