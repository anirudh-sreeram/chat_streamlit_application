[{"role": "context", "content": "Vang Vieng is a town in Vientiane province of Laos, lying on the Nam Song River. It is surrounded by karst topography. The town was first settled around 1353 as a staging post between Luang Prabang and the Laotian capital, Vientiane. Originally named Mouang Song after the body of the deceased King Phra Nha Phao of Phai Naam was seen floating down the river, the town was renamed Vang Vieng during French colonial rule in the 1890s. During the Vietnam War, the United States military constructed an air-force base and runway in Vang Vieng, known as \"Lima site 6\". Since Laos opened up for tourism in the late 1990s, the town has grown substantially due to the influx of backpacker tourism and associated business development. This view of the town and surrounding karst was taken from the top of Mount Nam Xay in June, during the monsoon season."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Extract all dates and provide context from the text as a direct quote.", "tags": ["detailed"]}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "The passage does not contain any specific date information but it mentions that: \n -the original name of the city was given when the remains of the former king were found at the bottom of the nearby river; this happened sometime before 1353 AD.\n -it was later called Vang Vieng during French colonization (in the early 20th century).\n -during the war with Vietnam, US built an Air Force Base there which they used until recently.", "rejected": "The following are some important events mentioned in this passage:\n\n - Settlement began around 1353 \n - Renamed Vang Vieng during French Colonial Rule (in the 1890's)  \n - Opened up for Tourist since the late 1990's", "model": "NOW_LLM_15.5b_v0.5.0_103123_alltoken_loss", "snaprejected": "The following are some important events mentioned in this passage:\n\n - Settlement began around 1353 \n - Renamed Vang Vieng during French Colonial Rule (in the 1890's)  \n - Opened up for Tourist since the late 1990's"}]
