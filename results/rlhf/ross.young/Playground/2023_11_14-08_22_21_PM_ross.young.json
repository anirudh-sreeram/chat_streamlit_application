[{"role": "context", "content": "Sedna is a trans-Neptunian object with the minor-planet number 90377. It was discovered on November 14, 2003, by the astronomers Michael Brown, Chad Trujillo, and David Rabinowitz. As of 2023, Sedna is 84 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, which is almost three times the distance between Neptune and the Sun. Sedna's orbit is an ellipse and its aphelion is approximately 937 AU (140 billion km). For most of its orbital period, Sedna is farther from the Sun than any known dwarf planet candidate of its size. Sedna is one of the reddest objects in the Solar System. It is mostly composed of frozen water, methane, and nitrogen with tholins. It may have formed within the same open cluster where the Sun was born as some astronomers suggest that Sedna is a celestial body captured by the Sun from another star system. Brown considers Sedna to be the most important trans-Neptunian object ever discovered, because its unusual orbit may yield information about the origin and early evolution of the Solar System."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Generate some insights from this text in the form of a document.", "tags": ["detailed", "good", "skimpy"]}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "The reference text provides several key insights into Sedna:\n\n1. Discovery: The discovery of Sedna was made on Nov. 14, 2003, by Michael Brown, Chad Trujillo, and David Rabinowitz using the Samuel Oschin Telescope at Palomar Observatory in California. This discovery marked the first time scientists had detected an object beyond Neptune in our solar system.\n\n2. Distance From Earth: Sedna currently orbits around 84 astronomical units (AU), which is equivalent to roughly 937 earths stacked together. That means it takes over 10,500 years for Sednas path to bring it back into range of being able to observe it again! \n\n3. Orbit Details: Sednas orbit is quite eccentric, meaning it swings widely from very close to the sun all the way out past Pluto before looping back towards us once more. Its average distance from the sun is actually greater than both Uranus and Neptunes combined!\n\n4. Composition: Sedna appears to consist primarily of frozen water ice mixed with other substances such as methane and ammonia. These compounds collectively form what we call \"tholin.\" Tholins play crucial roles in regulating temperature throughout space environments like those found near stars like our own sun.\n\n5. Potential Origins: One intriguing possibility regarding Sednas origins involves considering whether or not it might somehow have been ejected from a nearby star system during its formation process. If so, then Sedna could potentially provide valuable clues about how similar processes occurred here on Earth billions of years ago when our solar system began taking shape.", "rejected": "The reference text discusses Sedna, a distant trans-Neptunian object located beyond the Kuiper belt. The discovery of Sedna revealed new dimensions regarding our understanding of the solar system. Here are some key takeaways:\n\n1. Discovery: Discovered in 2003 by Michael Brown, Chad Trujillo, and David Rabinowitz using the Spitzer Space Telescope. This discovery expanded our knowledge of the outer regions of the solar system.\n\n2. Distance From Earth: Located at a staggering 84 astronomical units (AU) away from earth, it is more distant than Pluto but closer to Saturn. Its current location makes it difficult for us to observe directly due to light diffraction effects caused by its large radius. However, future missions like New Horizons will attempt to study Sedna up close.\n\n3. Orbit Characteristics: Sedna has an eccentric orbit that takes it through both the inner and outer parts of the solar system. Unlike other known planets or moons, Sedna's orbit brings it much further out into space than expected based on its mass alone. Scientists hypothesize that Sedna could either have been ejected from a different region of the galaxy during the formation of the solar system or possibly even originates outside of our own Milky Way Galaxy!\n\n4. Composition: Sedna appears to consist primarily of frozen volatile compounds such as water, ammonia, carbon monoxide, methane, and nitrogen. These substances make up around 56% of its total volume, making them quite similar chemically to comets. Additionally, scientists found evidence suggesting the presence of organic molecules called \"tholin\" inside Sedna, indicating potential biological activity within the object itself.\n\n5.
