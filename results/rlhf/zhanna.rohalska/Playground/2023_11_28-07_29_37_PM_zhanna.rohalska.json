She was initially an unsuccessful writer with six consecutive rejections, but this changed in 1920 when The Mysterious Affair at Styles, featuring detective Hercule Poirot, was published. Her first husband was Archibald Christie; they married in 1914 and had one child before divorcing in 1928. Following the breakdown of her marriage and the death of her mother in 1926 she made international headlines by going missing for eleven days. During both World Wars, she served in hospital dispensaries, acquiring a thorough knowledge of the poisons that featured in many of her novels, short stories, and plays. Following her marriage to archaeologist Max Mallowan in 1930, she spent several months each year on digs in the Middle East and used her first-hand knowledge of this profession in her fiction.\n\nWhich hands-on knowledge became very useful to Agatha Christie while writing her books?"}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "Her knowledge of poisons acquired during her work in hospital dispensaries and her first-hand experience as an archaeologist from her time spent on digs with her second husband.", "rejected": "her knowledge of poisons from working in hospitals and her first-hand experience of archaeology from being married to an archaeologist", "model": "NOW_LLM_llama13b_111523", "snaprejected": "her knowledge of poisons from working in hospitals and her first-hand experience of archaeology from being married to an archaeologist", "snapchosen": "Her knowledge of poisons acquired during her work in hospital dispensaries and her first-hand experience as an archaeologist from her time spent on digs with her second husband."}]
