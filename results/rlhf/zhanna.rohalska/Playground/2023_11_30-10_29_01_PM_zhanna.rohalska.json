Two decades after the Communist revolution in China, Beijing and Washington still had no official relations and Nixon, though he was a fierce anti-Communist, wanted to devise a way to pull the Chinese\u2014a fifth of the world\u2019s population\u2014into the global system. Kissinger, who died on Wednesday, at the age of a hundred, had his own motives: he intended to \u201cplay off China against Russia,\u201d he later recalled, in an oral history that was published in the book \u201cKissinger on Kissinger.\u201d \u201cWe did not want Russia to be the sole spokesman of the communist world; we wanted to split it.\u201d\n\nAt the outset, Nixon and Kissinger were not an obvious pairing. During the Republican Presidential primaries, in 1968, while advising a rival candidate, Kissinger had described the hawkish, mercurial Nixon as \u201cthe most dangerous of all the men running.\u201d But, after Nixon secured the nomination, Kissinger\u2019s stature, and his ambition, brought them together, and he became a confidant. In office, they embarked on a clandestine, circuitous, and highly personalized mission. Visiting Paris, for Charles de Gaulle\u2019s funeral, in 1970, Nixon spotted the Chinese Ambassador at a reception in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, and nudged Kissinger to improvise an approach, saying, \u201cIf you find him standing alone for a minute, go up to him and tell him we want to talk.\u201d But the Ambassador was never alone, and the moment passed. Next, Nixon and Kissinger tried to make contact through Poland; under the pretext of attending a fashion show at the Yugoslav Embassy in Warsaw, the U.S. Ambassador suddenly advanced toward his Chinese counterpart. \u201cHe ran away,\u201d Kissinger recalled, \u201cand our ambassador ran after him, and handed him this request.\u201d\n\nSummarize the text by copying the main ideas.
