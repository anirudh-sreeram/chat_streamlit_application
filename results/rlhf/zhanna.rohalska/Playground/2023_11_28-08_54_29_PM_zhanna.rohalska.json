[{"role": "context", "content": "Describe in several sentences."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Dylan was born and raised in St. Louis County, Minnesota. Following his self-titled debut album of traditional folk songs in 1962, he made his breakthrough as a songwriter with the release of The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan the next year. The album features \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\" which, like many of his early songs, adapted the tunes and phrasing of older folk songs. He went on to release the politically charged The Times They Are a-Changin' and the more lyrically abstract and introspective Another Side of Bob Dylan in 1964. In 1965 and 1966, Dylan drew controversy among folk purists when he adopted electrically amplified rock instrumentation, and in the space of 15 months recorded three of the most important and influential rock albums of the 1960s: Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited (both 1965) and Blonde on Blonde (1966). His six-minute single \"Like a Rolling Stone\" (1965) expanded commercial and creative boundaries in popular music.\n\nWhere was Bob Dylan born? Which album helped him achieve a breakthrough?
