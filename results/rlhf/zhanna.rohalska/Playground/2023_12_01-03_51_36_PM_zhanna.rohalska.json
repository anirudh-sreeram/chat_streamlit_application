Probably the first experimental works with a conceptual bent were made much earlier than the period mentioned above.\n\nConceptual photography is usually staged, but, theoretically, it can be random \u2014 when author, seeing a \u201cscene\u201d worth capturing, instantly directs the lens and presses the button.\n\nProvide a very short summary of 1-2 sentences max."}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "Conceptual photography is a genre of photography where the photographer adds conceptual meaning to a photo through staging or other means.", "rejected": "Conceptual photography is a genre of photography where the photographer intends to convey a specific message or idea through their photographs.", "model": "NOW_LLM_llama13b_111523", "snapchosen": "Conceptual photography is a genre of photography where the photographer adds conceptual meaning to a photo through staging or other means.", "snaprejected": "Conceptual photography is a genre of photography where the photographer intends to convey a specific message or idea through their photographs."}]
