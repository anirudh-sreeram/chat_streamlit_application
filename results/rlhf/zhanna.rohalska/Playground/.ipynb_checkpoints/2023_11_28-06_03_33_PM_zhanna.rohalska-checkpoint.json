Its name originated from the Wiradjuri language in reference to the call it makes. There are four species of kookaburra found in Australia; Rufous-bellied, spangled, blue-winged, and laughing kookaburras (its loud call is commonly used as stock sound effect). These species can grow up to 11-17 inches long and are exclusively carnivores, feeding on snakes, mice, small reptiles, and insects. These birds are territorial and can be found in a wide range of habitat, from arid savannah to humid forest and urban areas with tall trees. Although they are kingfishers, Kookaburras are not closely associated with water.\n\nPut down in a numbered list all the adjectives used in this text to describe Kookaburras.
