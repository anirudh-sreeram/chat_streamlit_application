German shepherds - These intelligent and loyal dogs were originally developed to herd livestock and have a strong sense of duty and responsibility towards their family or handler. They are often used as police dogs due to their ability to work well in teams and perform tasks independently. \n\n2. Bulldogs- Known for their muscular build and low stance, these dogs can be both friendly and fierce when defending what they consider their territory. With proper socialization early on, this dog makes an excellent watchdog and is not easily startled by strangers entering its space.\n\n3. Labradors \u2013 This medium sized dog has been one of America\u2019s most popular pets since 1990 according to AKC registration statistics. Labs are very sociable with people but also possess high prey drive which means they will alert you if there's something unusual going on outside your home.\n\n4. Siberian huskies\u2013 Originally bred to pull sleds across harsh Arctic terrain, these athletic dogs love being active outdoors and form strong bonds with their families. Despite their small size, they still exhibit aggressive behavior toward intruders making them good candidates for personal protection.\n\n5. Chihuahuas \u2013 While smaller than many other breeds, chihuahuas pack big attitude! Their short legs may seem like weakness, however it actually gives them better balance while running around after potential threats. Plus, don't underestimate those tiny teeth; just ask any rodent who crosses paths with a chihuahua!", "rejected": "The breeds of dog listed are not typically considered to be good choices for a guard dog due their size and/or lack of aggression towards strangers or other animals:\n\n German shepherds have been used as police dogs in many countries around the world but they can also suffer from separation anxiety if left alone too much. Bulldogs tend to be friendly with everyone so may not always act as a deterrent against intruders. Labradors are very popular family pets who love being active outdoors; however, it's important to note that these dogs were originally bred for hunting purposes rather than protection work. Siberian huskies are known for their loyalty and intelligence but they're generally more suited to living in colder climates where there is less need for them to protect their owners. Chihuahuas are small dogs that don't usually growl at people entering your home (unless you've taught them this behavior). Dachshunds are short-legged dogs that aren't particularly tall enough to see over fences or walls when guarding property either. In conclusion, while some of these breeds might make excellent companions, none would necessarily serve well as watchful protectors outside the household environment without additional training and socialization efforts.", "model": "NOW_LLM_15.5b_v0.5.0_103123_alltoken_loss", "snapchosen": "The following breeds are known for their protective and guarding instinct:\n\n1.
