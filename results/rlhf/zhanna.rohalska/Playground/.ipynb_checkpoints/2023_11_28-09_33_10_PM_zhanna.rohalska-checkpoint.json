In the Golden Chords, he performed covers of songs by Little Richard[23] and Elvis Presley.[24] Their performance of Danny & the Juniors' \"Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay\" at their high school talent show was so loud that the principal cut the microphone.[25] In 1959, Dylan's high school yearbook carried the caption \"Robert Zimmerman: to join 'Little Richard'\".[23][26] That year, as Elston Gunnn, he performed two dates with Bobby Vee, playing piano and clapping.[27][28][29] In September 1959, Dylan moved to Minneapolis and enrolled at the University of Minnesota.[30] His focus on rock and roll gave way to American folk music, as he explained in a 1985 interview:\n\nThe thing about rock'n'roll is that for me anyway it wasn't enough ... There were great catch-phrases and driving pulse rhythms ... but the songs weren't serious or didn't reflect life in a realistic way. I knew that when I got into folk music, it was more of a serious type of thing. The songs are filled with more despair, more sadness, more triumph, more faith in the supernatural, much deeper feelings.\n\nWhat did Dylan do when he was in Hibbing High school? Why the principal was not very happy with his & his buddies' performance? When did he move to Minneapolis & what did he do there? Which type of music did he talk about in his interview?"}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "While attending Hibbing High School, Dylan formed several bands and performed covers of songs by Little Richard and Elvis Presley.
