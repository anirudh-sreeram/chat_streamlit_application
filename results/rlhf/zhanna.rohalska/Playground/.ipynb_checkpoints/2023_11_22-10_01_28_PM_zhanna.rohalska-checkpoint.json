(2) Existence is primarily the problem of existence (i.e., of its mode of being); it is, therefore, also the investigation of the meaning of Being. (3) That investigation is continually faced with diverse possibilities, from among which the existent (i.e., the human individual) must make a selection, to which he must then commit himself. (4) Because those possibilities are constituted by the individual\u2019s relationships with things and with other humans, existence is always a being-in-the-world\u2014i.e., in a concrete and historically determinate situation that limits or conditions choice. Humans are therefore called, in Martin Heidegger\u2019s phrase, Dasein (\u201cthere being\u201d) because they are defined by the fact that they exist, or are in the world and inhabit it."}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "The philosophy of existentialism holds that individuals have free will over their actions but face an absurd universe where there are no objective moral values; thus, each person has to find value within themselves through personal experiences.", "rejected": "This paper explores how philosophical ideas about freedom have developed over time.
