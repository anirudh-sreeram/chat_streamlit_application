[{"role": "context", "content": "Summarization. Long summary. 6-7 sentences"}, {"role": "user", "content": "In \u201cDream Scenario,\u201d the new A24 film from the writer-director Kristoffer Borgli, Nicolas Cage plays Paul Matthews, an underappreciated and ineffectual college professor who finds fame because of an odd metaphysical happenstance: he unwittingly begins appearing in people\u2019s dreams all over the world. The film, which follows Paul through his brief rise and seemingly endless fall, could have only worked with Cage in the lead. Paul has shades of Bryan Cranston\u2019s Walter White and Paul Giamatti\u2019s Miles, in \u201cSideways,\u201d but it\u2019s hard to imagine any actor but Cage embracing the hairpin tonal shifts that the part requires. When we first meet Paul, Cage\u2019s performance seems slightly off, too big and, perhaps, too artificial for a film that needs grounding in real emotions. It\u2019s almost as if Cage is wearing Paul as a mask. He has altered his voice (it\u2019s high pitched and adenoidal), his walk (he\u2019s hunched over, almost cowering), and his hairline (a curious tonsure of baldness). But soon we realize that it is Paul who is slightly off, too heightened for his surroundings. As we watch him rehearse social interactions and recite canned jokes, it becomes clear that he\u2019s in pain, and enraged, and he has pasted on the visage of a happy family man\u2014one that Cage peels off to reveal the yearning, desperation, and monstrous ego hiding underneath.\n\nBut Cage\u2019s casting is important to the film for more than one reason. With its lacerating examination on the dehumanizing effects of viral fame, \u201cDream Scenario\u201d is a commentary on how the Internet has changed the way we interact with the world and has turned everything into fodder for memes. You could also see it as a commentary on how the Internet has changed the way we watch and appreciate Nicolas Cage, who is one of the first movie stars to become meme-ified.\n\nCage is now in the fifth decade of a career that spans more than a hundred films and has included stints as a teen heartthrob, an irrepressible eccentric, an action star, and an Oscar-festooned Serious Actor. But the Internet era overwrote these roles with another one: a cultural joke. In the early two-thousands, Cage, like Paul, found a new (perhaps unwelcome) fame as a new kind of (inadvertent) star for a new kind of (unremunerative) medium. And then, like Paul, he lost control over his new image and was reduced to a punch line. Over the past five years, he has moved into a comeback phase, one that may restore him to respectability, if not reliable box-office. None of his recent films have made a huge amount of money, but he is once again being well reviewed, appearing on talk shows, and working with larger budgets and big studios after a career tailspin that felt potentially terminal.\n\nPlease provide a long summary of 6-7 sentences.

Only Cage could have pulled off the role, given its demanding mix of comedy and pathos. At first, Cage's performance appears exaggerated, but it's soon clear that the character is the one who's off-kilter. As Paul puts on a false front to hide what's beneath, Cage strips away the facade to showcase the pain, rage, and insecurity within. Beyond the film's exploration of viral fame and its impact on identity, \"Dream Scenario\" can also be seen as a commentary on how the internet has transformed the way we view Nicolas Cage himself. Once typecast as a serious actor, Cage became an unintentional meme sensation in the early 2000s, leading to a shift in his public perception. Throughout his decades-long career, Cage has taken on various roles, from teen heartthrob to action star, only to see them overshadowed by his internet persona.
