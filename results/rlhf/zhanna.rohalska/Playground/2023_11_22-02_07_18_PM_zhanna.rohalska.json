The player is given a sequence of commands, called \"Simon says\", which they must follow exactly as they are given. Each command consists of a single action that the player should perform, such as tapping their finger on their head or making a specific sound.\n\n2. If the player makes an error during any step of the sequence, they lose and the game ends immediately. However, if they successfully complete all steps without making errors, then they win and can continue to play until they make an error.\n\n3. During each round of the game, Simon will give the player a new set of commands, starting with one action and building up to longer sequences over time. As long as the player follows each command correctly, Simon will reward them by saying \"Good job!\" After completing a full sequence, he'll say \"Simon says\" again before giving another series of actions.", "rejected": "Sure, here are the basic rules for playing Simon Says:\n\n1) The player is given a sequence of commands by the \"Simon\" and must follow them exactly.

The goal is to score as many points as possible without making any mistakes.\n\n3) At the start of each round, the player is shown a pattern of lights on a device called a \"Simon\", which may have different colors or shapes depending on the version of the game being played. As part of the first command, the player will also be told how long their turn lasts - this could range from several seconds to minutes.", "model": "NOW_LLM_15.5b_v0.5.0_103123_alltoken_loss", "snapchosen": "Sure!
