He started the Reffetorios in 2016 with his wife, Lara Gilmore, to help combat the global problem of food waste \u2013 by utilising ingredients that might otherwise be thrown away by suppliers \u2013 and to give socially and economically vulnerable people access to high quality meals. Partnering with architects, artists and community leaders, the project is transforming underutilised spaces such as vacant churches and even a historical home into intentionally designed cultural centres equipped with kitchens, dining rooms and other facilities that help foster a sense of wellbeing, connection and inclusion.\n\nWhen I asked Bottura \u2013 who is regularly touted as one of the world's best chefs \u2013 why he creates such thoughtful cuisine within aesthetically appointed spaces for the underprivileged, he told me that everyone deserves respect and beauty \u2013 and of course, healthy food.\n\n\"I think these guys \u2013 these are beautiful souls,\" said Bottura. \"They are going to come in [to a Refettorio] and be completely disorientated because they're not used to coming into beautiful places like this. But once they're here, they realise that this place is their place. It's not my place.\"\n\nSummarize in 2-3 sentences & tell me who is this project mainly targeting and what are its benefits for these people? Do not copy & paste.
