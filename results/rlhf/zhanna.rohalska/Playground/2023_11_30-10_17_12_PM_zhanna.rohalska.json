Certainly, when it comes to celebrity couples, passion and ambition are typically inseparable. David and Victoria Beckham, who became an item in 1997, may have brought the pop star\u2013sports hero dyad to its modern apogee, making a billion hearts flutter while creating an interstellar expansion in their consumer base. Netflix\u2019s recent docuseries \u201cBeckham,\u201d directed by Fisher Stevens, reveals their pairing to be blissfully adolescent. (Him: \u201cI just fancied her.\u201d Her: \u201cI just fancied him.\u201d) Pop stardom combines with sporting glory in a particularly bountiful way: manna from the gods of promotion. \u201cMy daughter was so obsessed with them,\u201d Anna Wintour says in the first episode, \u201cthat I felt the world must be.\u201d\n\nIf you came of age amid the shining indivisibility of David and Victoria, it was impossible not to feel the push and pull of their particularly gigantic needs.

Behind this gauzy reassurance, of course, is the fear that we are all, in fact, utterly and completely alone, or, worse still, married to either Johnny Depp or Amber Heard.\n\nThere are few early nights in the marriages of celebrity couples. By a sort of completion instinct, the excitable participants in these unions will usually toil for extra pleasure, high on joint enterprise and happy to mock the midnight bell. Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z, together since 2001, have long seemed addicted to the special lights that illuminate celebrities. Softened by maturity, they now yearn for the things they wanted before they had everything. But though the Knowles-Carters may have magnified the brand spirit into a new sort of romance, the idea of the celebrity couple really began in an excess of fervency, entering a plastic palace to a fanfare of ancient tubas: to be precise, it began with Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, in the 1963 spectacular \u201cCleopatra.\u201d\n\n Please summarize in 5-6 sentences by paraphrasing.
