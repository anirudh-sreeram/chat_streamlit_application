Since the size you want is measured in centimeters, you will need to convert it to inches for the intent's entities. First, make sure that your desired model is available from Apple by checking their website or visiting a store. Then, using the conversion 1 cm = 0.3937 inches, calculate the size you want as approximately 74.8 inches (rounded up to the nearest whole number). Now you can create the payload for the intent with those values. For example, if you wanted the cheapest 75-inch option available from Apple, your payload might look like this:\n\n```\n{\n    \"model\": \"Apple 75-Inch Class A series (2021)\",\n    \"delivery_date\": \"N/A\"\n}\n```\nIf you do not specify a delivery date, then the default delivery estimate will be provided when the order is placed.
