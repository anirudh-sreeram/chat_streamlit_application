First, you should read the above YAML to understand how each intent is defined by reading the descriptions associated with each intent and understanding the constraints required for each intent. Each intent also has an example provided that specifies a viable utterance that would be classified into that given intent class. Each intent will also have a unique ID associated with it that starts with a upper case letter, 3 numbers, and 2 lower case letters.\n\nFor each intent there are also slots associated with them. Slots are values that need to be retrieved for a particular intent. Each slot will have a name, datatype, and description. It may also include a field possibleValues which means the slot must match one of the provided values. It could also include a field exampleValues where examples are given but the extracted slots do not need to exactly match those given values. If multiple slots are provided, fill all the slots. If a slot is not provided, set the value of the slot to N/A.\n\nBelow is an utterance. You should read the entirety of the utterance and determine which intent would best match the user\u2019s request. If there are multiple intents, that would match the utterance equally well, make sure to output both. For each chosen intent, extract the slots if present and set the slot value to N/A if it is not present.\n\nGive your final output as a JSON. The JSON should always have a key \u201coutput\u201d. The value of \u201coutput\u201d should be a dictionary where the key of this dictionary is the intent id and the values is a subdictionary where the keys are the slot ids associated with the given intent and the values are the slot values. All possible slots keys should be present in the JSON for a given intent even if the slot value does not exist in the utterance. If the output is not within this format, you will be heavily penalized."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Can you help me book a hotel in Puerto Rico?"}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "I'm sorry, but I am only able to assist with intents related to finding and booking flights.
