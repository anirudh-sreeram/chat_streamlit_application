This energy can be generated by a variety of geological processes, including the movement of tectonic plates, the sudden breaking of rock formations, and the impact of meteorites. The point of origin of an earthquake is called its focus, and the point on the surface directly above it is called its epicenter. Earthquakes can cause a lot of damage to infrastructure and can be very dangerous for people. Have a lovely day!\n\nFor a similar problem, consider the cause of volcanic eruptions. Volcanoes are formed when magma rises to the Earth's surface and erupts, causing a volcanic eruption.
