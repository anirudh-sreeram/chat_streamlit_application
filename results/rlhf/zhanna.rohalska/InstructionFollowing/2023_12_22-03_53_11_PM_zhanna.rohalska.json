Troubleshooting technical issues can sometimes be difficult, but let's see if we can get your modem back up and running. Firstly, ensure that your modem is powered on and that all cables are securely connected. Check for any error messages displayed on the modem or router, which might provide insight into the problem. Restart both devices by unplugging them for 10 seconds and then plugging them back in. This simple step often resolves many common issues. Next, check whether your modem has an indicator light for internet connectivity; it should be lit when a successful connection exists. If this light isn't on, try restarting your computer or device and then reconnecting to Wi-Fi to see if the problem lies with your device rather than the modem itself. Additionally, test another device to confirm whether the issue persists or is limited to one particular device alone. If none of these steps work and you remain unable to establish a connection, please let me know so we can explore additional solutions together. Remember that our goal is to get things working smoothly again, so don't hesitate to ask questions along the way!
