The film was released in 1984 and was directed by Milos Forman. It explores Mozart's rise to fame and his rivalry with the court composer Antonio Salieri.\n\nThe story begins with Salieri, now confined to an insane asylum, recounting the events that led to his obsession with destroying Mozart. As the film progresses, we see Mozart's humble beginnings in Salzburg, where he is introduced to the audience as a young prodigy who composes music effortlessly and performs in front of royalty. His unconventional compositions and rebellious nature clash with the rigid norms of 18th-century European society, leading to criticism and ridicule from the aristocracy.\n\nDespite the challenges he faces, Mozart remains resilient and continues to create timeless masterpieces, including \"The Marriage of Figaro\" and \"Don Giovanni.\" However, his personal life is marred by financial struggles, and his relationship with his wife, Constanze, is strained due to his dedication to his music.\n\nMeanwhile, Salieri, consumed by jealousy and a sense of artistic inferiority, schemes to undermine Mozart's success. He attempts to sabotage Mozart's career by spreading rumors and interfering with his opportunities. As Mozart's fame grows, Salieri's obsession deepens, leading him to question his own worth and purpose in life.\n\nThe film reaches a climactic point when Mozart is commissioned to write the opera \"La Clemenza di Tito\" for Emperor Joseph II. Salieri, realizing that he cannot destroy Mozart's talent, decides to take his own life instead.
