The sound of gentle waves lapping against the shore and the smell of coconut sunscreen filled the air. I couldn't help but smile, knowing I was finally on vacation.\n\nFor the next few days, I would be relaxing in a beautiful beachfront cabin, exploring the local attractions, and making memories with my family that would last a lifetime. Each morning, I woke up early to watch the sunrise over the ocean and take a refreshing swim in the cool waters. Then, I would spend the day lounging on the beach with a good book or taking part in various water sports like kayaking and paddleboarding.\n\nIn the evenings, I enjoyed delicious seafood dinners at local restaurants and took in the vibrant nightlife of the nearby towns. I even ventured out on a boat tour to see dolphins leaping through the waves and explored the nearby lighthouses and historic sites.\n\nThroughout it all, I felt a sense of relaxation and rejuvenation that only a vacation can bring. The stress and worries of daily life seemed to melt away as I immersed myself in the beauty and tranquility of the beach. It was the perfect way to unwind and create cherished memories with my loved ones.\n\nAs the vacation came to an end, I felt sad to leave but also grateful for the opportunity to experience such a wonderful getaway. I knew that the memories and experiences I had during those few days would stay with me forever, and I couldn't wait to plan my next adventure.", "tags": ["instrwants_register", "outbad_instr_format",

swim in waters cool and refreshing chase.\n\nThroughout the day, I lounged with a book in hand,\nOr played in the sea with a carefree look.\nI dined on seafood so fresh and so fine,\nAnd explored the nightlife with a smile so bright and shining.\n\nI ventured out on a boat so bold,\nTo see the dolphins leap and be so uncontrolled.\nI visited lighthouses that stood so tall and proud,\nAnd explored the history of towns that were so loud.\n\nAs the days went by, I felt my stress melt away,\nIn the beauty and calm of that beach vacation today.\nI created memories that will forever be,\nA reminder of the joy that vacation can bring to me.\n\nBut all good things must come to an end,\nAnd as my vacation did, it was hard to send.\nBut I left with a heart full of gratitude and cheer,\nFor the
