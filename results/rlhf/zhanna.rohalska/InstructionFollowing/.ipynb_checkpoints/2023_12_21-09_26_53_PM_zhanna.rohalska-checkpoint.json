First you'll want to make sure that your computer can support the resolution and refresh rate that you need. You don't want to buy a 4k 120hz monitor only for your graphics card or motherboard to not be able to drive it properly. Once you have all the parts you need, put the stand on the desk and mount the monitor using the included hardware. Make sure you use the proper screw length and torque so as not to damage either the stand or the monitor. Then plug in the power cable and hdmi/displayport cables into their respective ports and you should be good to go! If you're having issues getting the display set up on boot, try adjusting the display settings in your bios menu. And that's all there is to it! Let me know if I can further assist you. Have a great day!", "rejected": "Sure thing! First, check that your computer's graphics card supports dual monitors. Then, set your desired resolution and refresh rate for minimal tearing or stuttering. If your motherboard supports video output over USB Type-C, you can use a single cable to connect both devices. Make sure your desk has enough space for the second screen before continuing. You may also want to invest in a KVM switch to avoid clutter. Finally, mount your screens securely to prevent damage from accidental bumps or falls.
