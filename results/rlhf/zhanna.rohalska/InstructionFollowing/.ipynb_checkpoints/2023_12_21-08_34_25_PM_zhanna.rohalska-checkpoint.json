When setting up a new password it is important to choose something that is hard to guess but also memorable. A good way to create a unique yet memorable password is by using a phrase or sentence that is personally meaningful to you. For example: if you want to remember your passwords birthday use \"ilove21June1987!\" as your password. Another example could be a quote from your favorite movie or book such as \"ToInfinityAndBeyond!\" from Toy Story. Once you have chosen your password make sure to enable two factor authentication (2FA) for an extra layer of security.

Make it at least 12 characters long. The longer, the better.\n2. Use a combination of uppercase letters (e.g., A), lowercase letters (e.g., a), numbers (e.g., 5), and symbols (!, #, $).\n3. Avoid using easily guessable information like common names, dates, or repetitive patterns (e.g., abcde, 123456).\n4. Consider using a passphrase, which is a sentence or phrase that is easy to remember but hard to guess. For example, \"correcthorsebatterystaple\".\n5.
