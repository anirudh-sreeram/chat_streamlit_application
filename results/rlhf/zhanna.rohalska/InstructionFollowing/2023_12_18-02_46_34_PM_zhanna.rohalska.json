[{"role": "context", "content": "A basic task in sentiment analysis is classifying the polarity of a given text at the document, sentence, or feature/aspect level\u2014whether the expressed opinion in a document, a sentence or an entity feature/aspect is positive, negative, or neutral. Advanced, \"beyond polarity\" sentiment classification looks, for instance, at emotional states such as enjoyment, anger, disgust, sadness, fear, and surprise.[2]\n\nPrecursors to sentimental analysis include the General Inquirer,[3] which provided hints toward quantifying patterns in text and, separately, psychological research that examined a person's psychological state based on analysis of their verbal behavior.[4]\n\nSubsequently, the method described in a patent by Volcani and Fogel,[5] looked specifically at sentiment and identified individual words and phrases in text with respect to different emotional scales. A current system based on their work, called EffectCheck, presents synonyms that can be used to increase or decrease the level of evoked emotion in each scale.\n\nMany other subsequent efforts were less sophisticated, using a mere polar view of sentiment, from positive to negative, such as work by Turney,[6] and Pang[7] who applied different methods for detecting the polarity of product reviews and movie reviews respectively. This work is at the document level. One can also classify a document's polarity on a multi-way scale, which was attempted by Pang[8] and Snyder[9] among others: Pang and Lee[8] expanded the basic task of classifying a movie review as either positive or negative to predict star ratings on either a 3- or a 4-star scale, while Snyder[9] performed an in-depth analysis of restaurant reviews, predicting ratings for various aspects of the given restaurant, such as the food and atmosphere (on a five-star scale).\n\nFirst steps to bringing together various approaches\u2014learning, lexical, knowledge-based, etc.\u2014were taken in the 2004 AAAI Spring Symposium where linguists, computer scientists, and other interested researchers first aligned interests and proposed shared tasks and benchmark data sets for the systematic computational research on affect, appeal, subjectivity, and sentiment in text.[10]"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize the key ideas from the above text (don't just copy & paste sentences that don't carry key info) & put them into a numbered list.

Early precursors of sentiment analysis included techniques like the General Inquirer, which aimed to quantify patterns in text, and psychological research studying how people's emotions are reflected in their language. \n3. Later advancements focused on specific sentiment identification, pinpointing words and phrases in texts corresponding to different emotional scales. Tools like EffectCheck utilized this approach. \n4. Some earlier works adopted a more straightforward binary perspective of sentiment, categorizing documents as predominantly positive or negative. \n5. More complex attempts incorporated multidimensional classifications, where documents could be assigned ratings on multiple scales; examples include predicting star ratings for movie reviews or rating aspects of services like restaurants. \n6.
