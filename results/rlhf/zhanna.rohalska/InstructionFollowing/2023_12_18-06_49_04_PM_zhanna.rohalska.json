It is a single layer of flat cells (simple squamous epithelium) glued by a polysaccharide intercellular matrix, surrounded by a thin layer of subendothelial connective tissue interlaced with a number of circularly arranged elastic bands called the internal elastic lamina. A thin membrane of elastic fibers in the tunica intima run parallel to the vessel.\nThe middle layer tunica media is the thickest layer in arteries. It consists of circularly arranged elastic fiber, connective tissue, polysaccharide substances, the second and third layer are separated by another thick elastic band called external elastic lamina. The tunica media may (especially in arteries) be rich in vascular smooth muscle, which controls the caliber of the vessel. Veins do not have the external elastic lamina, but only an internal one. The tunica media is thicker in the arteries rather than the veins.\nThe outer layer is the tunica adventitia and the thickest layer in veins. It is entirely made of connective tissue. It also contains nerves that supply the vessel as well as nutrient capillaries (vasa vasorum) in the larger blood vessels.\n\n\n"}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "Here's my attempt at rhyming some of the medical terms from the text with random words:\n\n\"The innermost layer, oh what a wonder, it's the thinnest of all, like a single layer of flat cell underwear.\"\nTunica Intima - simple squamous epithelium\n\"With a polysaccharide glue, holding it together like a sticky goo.\"\nPolysaccharide Intercellular Matrix\n\"Surrounded by a thin layer of connective tissue, like a delicate embrace, entwined with elastic bands that form a beautiful dance.\"\nSubendothelial Connective Tissue - Internal Elastic Lamina\n\"In the tunica media, the layers get thicker, with elastic fibers that stretch like a tick-tock timer.\"\nElastic Fibers - External Elastic Lamina\n\"Veins lack the outside cradle, but the inside one still holds them together like a loving hug.\"\nInternal Elastic Lamina - External Elastic Lamina\n\"Oh, the tunica adventitia, the outermost layer so grand, like a coat of armor protecting each blood vessel's land.\"\nTunica Adventitia\nI hope you enjoy these cheeky rhymes!
