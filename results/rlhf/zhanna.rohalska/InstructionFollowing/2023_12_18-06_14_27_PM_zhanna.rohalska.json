It is a single layer of flat cells (simple squamous epithelium) glued by a polysaccharide intercellular matrix, surrounded by a thin layer of subendothelial connective tissue interlaced with a number of circularly arranged elastic bands called the internal elastic lamina. A thin membrane of elastic fibers in the tunica intima run parallel to the vessel.\nThe middle layer tunica media is the thickest layer in arteries. It consists of circularly arranged elastic fiber, connective tissue, polysaccharide substances, the second and third layer are separated by another thick elastic band called external elastic lamina. The tunica media may (especially in arteries) be rich in vascular smooth muscle, which controls the caliber of the vessel. Veins do not have the external elastic lamina, but only an internal one. The tunica media is thicker in the arteries rather than the veins.\nThe outer layer is the tunica adventitia and the thickest layer in veins. It is entirely made of connective tissue. It also contains nerves that supply the vessel as well as nutrient capillaries (vasa vasorum) in the larger blood vessels."}, {"role": "robot", "chosen": "Here's a bullet list of all the medical terms of Latin origin mentioned in the reference text:\n- Tunica Intima\n- Tunica Media\n- Tunica Adventitia\n- Simple squamous epithelium\n- Polysaccharide\n- Elastic Fibers\n- External Elastic Lamina\n- Internal Elastic Lamina \n- Vasa Vasorum\n- Connective Tissue\n- Circularly Arranged Elastic Fibers", "rejected": "Here's a bullet list of the medical terms of Latin origin mentioned in the reference text:\n* Tunica Intima - \"intima\" meaning innermost or deepest part, refers to the innermost layer of the blood vessel.\n* Tunica Media - \"media\" meaning middle, refers to the middle layer of the blood vessel. \n* Tunica Adventitia - \"adventitia\" means outermost or outer side, referring to the outermost layer of the blood vessel.\n* Polysaccharide - \"poly\" meaning many, and \"saccharide\" meaning sugar; it indicates a complex carbohydrate consisting of long chains of sugars.\n* Elastic Lamina - \"lamina\" meaning sheet or plate, indicating the layers of elastin fibers that provide flexibility and resilience to the blood vessel walls.\n* Vasa Vasorum - \"vasa\" meaning vessels, and \"vorum\" meaning relating to devouring; these are small blood vessels that supply and nourish the larger blood vessels. \n* Subendothelial Connective Tissue - \"subendo\" meaning beneath, and \"thelial\" meaning pertaining to the lining; this describes the layer of connective tissue underneath the innermost layer of the blood vessel wall.", "model": "NOW_LLM_llama13b_convclass_dpo_12723_nonpairwise_loss"}]
