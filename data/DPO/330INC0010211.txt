It's been sent in and approved by me. Yaseen, I'm not sure how long it will take to get paid, but I don't think it will be long.

I really appreciate you talking to me about the invoice that is attached.  I'll remember to approve it and send the payment for it today. When the payment is authorized, when can we anticipate it to process?

Tell me if you need anything, please for processing.

Hello,

Recently, Evan Trucking assigned me your account. I would want to introduce myself and ask that you feel free to get in touch with me if you need any help with paperwork, invoice copies, or anything else relating to invoices.

I notice that invoices are being sent to  lounist.payables@fergfurg.com<mailto:lounist.payables@fergfurg.com> .  Would you kindly verify that this email address is the right one to use for sending bills? Which email address is best to use to find out the status of your payment?

Could you please let me know how the November invoice that is attached is being paid? We must find a solution to this as soon as possible. We've made multiple attempts to contact you, but we've never heard back.

Thanks for your assistance in advance!
