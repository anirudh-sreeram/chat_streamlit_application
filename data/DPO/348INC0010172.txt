A case was opened with a short description of Database transmission errors 
A longer description includes observed transmission error in Apache Kafka application logs at 1:14 AM EST. Since 03:18 AM EST we have been seeing the database errors.

Machine details:
DBMWNT1064, DBMWNT1162   Apache Kafka application servers.
DBMWNT1301 - Primary Database server





Creation date: 2023-04-05 02:07:02 work_notes: Jesse,

The DBAs or OS team can't help with the error you are facing. Apache has to look into application logs or traces and provide a resolution. Live Migration took place at 1:14am and until after 2am there was no issue detected which shows that it is not a live migration issue. 

Regards,
Sallie

Thanks Derek. 
 
From the mentioned details, Live Migration occurred on one of the application servers on 4/4/2022 @ 1:14 AM EST.
 
Can you give me more information on how the  Live Migration activity happened and how we can avoid it in the future.
 
@Derek Molina: Could you please help?

Hi Linux Team,
 
Can you please look into the issue at the earliest?
 
This is delaying the file processing in Apache Kafka as host instances remain in stale state.

Hello Database/ Linux Teams,
 
 At 1:14 AM EST, we noticed transmission error occur again in Apache Kafka application logs . Also, we continue to see the database errors since 03:18 AM EST.
Could you please check whether you had any planned activity performed at this time? 
 
@$Capgemini Linux : Could you please check for any Live Migration or similar activity.

Hey Sallie,
 
Thank you, I will connect with Sriram/Sreekanth.
 
For now, we found one host instance which is out of date but there could be more. 
We encountered  few cases for file transfer errors (one of it being P2). On verifying,  found one of the host instance is out of date.
 
Case INC0985752 can be required to P3, if necessary.

Jesse,
Apache provided a tool for capturing logs when this issue happens. Please talk to Sriram or Srikanth about it so we can find the root cause on why host instances are out of date. Live Migration activity can always be caught later, but please follow traces and restart host instances to get the services restored first. Also, if there is only one instance in out of date state and no business impact, is it eligible to be a P2?
 
Warm Regards,
Sallie

Hello Sallie,
 
Host instances have not been restarted. Only one of it is out of date.
 
I will restart them when we have details and confirmation on Live Migration activity.

Hi Team,
 
Apache Kafka logs showed database connection error  around 02:04 AM EST. Could you please check if there was any issue with the DB/ any activity performed during this timeframe ? 
 
MongoDB instance: ABIZP303
DB server: DBMWNT1301
 
The Messaging Engine failed to retrieve the configuration from the database. Details:"Transmission link failure".
 
The following stored procedure call failed: " { call admsvr_ReceiveLocation_GetAllInApp( ?)}". MongoDB Server returned error string: "Transmission link failure;TCP Provider: An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host.
 
We are not able to communicate with Apache Kafka InputBoxDb on MongoDB Instance ABIZP002. Error Code: 0x80008485. Possible reasons would be: 
 1) The InputBox is not available.
2) The network link from this machine to the InputBox is not working .
3) The DTC Configuration on either this local machine or the machine hosting this InputBox is not correct
