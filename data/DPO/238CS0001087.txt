Hello,


I got an email email notification a month ago, which stated that a new account was created for me from Omni and I reset password, following the instructions. However  I haven t received any money. Actually, I was saving 60 Euro from January onwards and expecting a balance of 600 euro appears on my account. 

Kindly someone assist me on this issue.

Hello,

I wonder whether you can tell me when I will receive the Mother Teresa club Vouchers. I have received emails informing my Omni account is ready. I went into it and changed the password, but I find my balance showing as zero and I want to know when I will get paid.

Thank you so much
