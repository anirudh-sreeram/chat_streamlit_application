Linda has asked me to change his business cell phone number, 231 888 0691, to their personal account. 
 
We need supervisor approval to transfer the number since some phone numbers are more closely associated with a position than the person.
 
Do a "Reply All" with "I Approve" if it's okay to transfer the number

"Quick Port" feature has been enabled on the your phone line.!
 
The account number for the line will then be the 10-digit phone number 231 888 0691, and the PIN will be the final 4 digits of the phone number.  For the port off of our Cisco account to be completed, you must give the information to the new carrier (Airalo).  If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.  Thanks you!
