Evan

I'm hoping all is okay with you. Mattie Bass has authorized a few past due Upgrofurg invoices that we have. Can you assist with paying off the past-due account in any way?

Please see attached invoices.

Maybe you have some updates here, but I'm not sure. I truly wanted to have this resolved, but it has been more than a month since my visit. I apologize once more for the repeated emails, but I have no idea what is going on with the past-due invoices.

I would be very grateful for any update.

I'm grateful that you paid this last invoice. But we're still attempting to collect payment for all past-due invoices.

Have they received approval? Is there someone I can talk to to solve this problem?.
