Hello Blaine,

I trust you are in good health!

We require Pearl to retransmit the contract because she solely included the final page.

 

In order to proceed with the payment, we need all 6 pages to be scanned. Could we kindly inform Pearl about this?

Appreciate it.

Best Wishes,
Mackenzie Baldwin
