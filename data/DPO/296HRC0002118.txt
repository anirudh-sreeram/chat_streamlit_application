Certainly - I just required Cleo to incorporate the Employer Identification Number (EIN), and then I can proceed.

Good day Nana,
E We completed the hiring process and brought on Ronnie Schultz as a Commercial Relief Driver. Regrettably, Robbie failed to verify his eligibility for rehire, and the system currently designates him as ineligible due to his initial workday absence.  It's peculiar because he should have interviewed with Kane for the personal question, but Kane has no recollection of him. Kane suspects there might be an error in this record and would like to conduct an interview for potential hiring.  He's set for onboarding next Wednesday. Is there any possibility we can modify his eligibility status?
