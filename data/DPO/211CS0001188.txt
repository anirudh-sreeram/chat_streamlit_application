A case was opened with a short description of ASR crash
A longer description includes  One of our VMs stopped replicating to Azure and replication will not resume. OG-NAV-RTC02 is the server name. We attempted disabling and re-enabling the replication and removed and reinstalled the mobility service agent but nothing is working.

Thanks for reaching out to Nimbus Help.  I'm Ezekiel Hancock, an engineer with Nimbus Structure Support, and I'll be guiding you with your Azure Site Recovery problem.  Can you kindly confirm the Recovery Services Vault which the machines are being replicated to and/or the subscription ID: qb334949-6b45-4720-86e0-c2f3c40a8c1d?  The subscription is not showing any active replications or replicated items currently. Could you also confirm the Customer ID in the Nimbus Portal?

Thanks,
Ezekiel

The subscription ID is ref84d3b-12a3-6d69-qc37-6b85e620a816 and the Recovery Services Vault is OG-RSV-Prod

I saw the company was duplicated when I was opening the ticket. There were two entries, sweetleaf and Sweet Leaf. I might have selected the wrong one

No problem! I wanted to make sure I was looking at the right info which is why I asked. It looks like you disabled and re-enabled the replication and the mobility service agent is being reinstalled. Did you check whether the source machine is connected to the Process server?
That seems to be the where the breakdown in communication is happening.

Thanks,

Creation date: 2022-10-04 18:40:24 comments: Yes I did that. I don't think communication is the problem here.
I got some errors in the cxps log saying  access denied  but I don't know what to do with them.
Creation date: 2022-10-04 19:06:30 comments: Robert,

Could you add these logs to the case? I can use them to figure out our next steps.

Thanks,
Ezekiel
Creation date: 2022-10-04 19:30:38 comments: The log records are quite large so I just took the copy from the tail end of them into new records and attached them. A client IP of 10.100.4.82 which has the log entries are the ones referred to the host in query
Creation date: 2022-10-04 20:19:11 comments: Hi Robert,

Can we do a screen share? I want to look into a couple of things on the OG-NAV-RTC02 and Process Server.  I can meet from 3:30 - 4:30 pm CDST and from at 9 am and 12 pm CDST tomorrow.  
Would any of those times work for you?

Thanks,
Ezekiel
Creation date: 2022-10-04 20:43:50 comments: Yes, I can do either of those times. 

Creation date: 2022-10-04 21:07:24 comments: Hi Robert,

Tomorrow morning  I scheduled a meet for 9 CDST in Teams. 
Then I will be waiting to have a conversation with you.

Thanks,
Ezekiel
Creation date: 2022-10-05 15:14:28 comments: Hi Robert,

Hope all is well. My meeting ran late until 15 after. If you would be ok with rescheduling. I can do 10 - 10:30 CDST today and I also have a window open from 10:30 am - 12:30 pm CDST tomorrow on August 6.

Thanks,
Ezekiel

Hi everyone, Robert, just so you are aware, the Microsoft Product Group team has been assigned to your case. This team cannot be reached by anyone other than the engineers assigned to the cases. There is no manager for this team and cases cannot be escalated beyond them. This team are a busy group and cases they receive can be addressed and resolved anywhere from 24 hours to "the patch will be implemented next quarter". I don't mean to frighten you, just want you to know what to expect.
Thanks!
