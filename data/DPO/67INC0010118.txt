Hi Talia,

I have changed the name of the file "Calendly - Scheduling List.csv" as "Calendly - Scheduling List_bckup3rd April2022" since I don't know how important the file to be removed is beforehand.

Could you please confirm now if this is fine or we have to still remove this file? Thanks!


Regards,

Fabian Park
