Hello Daisy,

Greetings!!

I'm Aryan, a Service Delivery Associate presently working with Conexess, and I wanted to get in touch with you to arrange a quick conversation to discuss how Conexess may assist with your program's staffing needs. Please feel free to contact me.

A brief summary of Conexess (Company Profile Attached) is as follows:
Conexess have been a top provider for various programmes with Saturn Cloud, CORE Higher Education Group, SecureVision, & Monstor Worldwide and would like to see whether there is a fit and/or a shared interest with Ripping. For roles in IT, non-IT, healthcare, infrastructure, engineering, the automotive industry, medical devices, etc., we obtain strong profiles. We firmly believe in diversity and inclusion and actively promote it within both our internal teams and culture as well as provide our clients with competent and diverse contingent workers. At the time, 38 percent of our entire workforce is diverse.

The following are the skill sets that my team uses assist our clients (you can see the detailed list on the attached document)
