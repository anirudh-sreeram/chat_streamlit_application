Please help me with the message below. It appears that the cloudflare mailbox is no longer functional, hence it was revoked.

Hello Cloudflare,

Please change Annie Morris' manager to me (Shreya Banks). I am not sure why Louis is reflected here when this transition has already been made through contingent workers/HR.

Hello Shreya,

I hope all is okay with you. Just letting you know that, on Annie's behalf, this is going to be signed with her later today. I want to point out that Louis is still listed as the Manager.
I hope you have a wonderful day.
Regards

Siobhan Vega
