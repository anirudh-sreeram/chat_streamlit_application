Subject: RE: I'm grateful

I agree with you, Mitchell! Thank you @ Bonnie Barton
<Bonnie.Barton@Supplyhouse.com> for giving us the opportunity to participate in the BRG. This was a great way for the BRG to support this mission, and the fellows seemed to enjoy the opportunity to hear from the leadership and learn more about the supply house.

Here is a sneak glance at the few images::

Louise will be out of the office tomorrow, but we will catch up the following week. I will share some photos and the form link that she promised to send along to the fellows, asking for their opinions, particularly on their visit to the supply house. These findings will be included in an article that will be sent to the BRG and pipeline. Moving forward, I expect even more from the veteran-led BRG.

Have a fantastic evening.

Happy afternoon!

Wow! What a fantastic occasion. Thank you everybody for your time and work in making it happen. I can't wait to see the photos, get the reaction from the Honor foundation fellows, and see who ends up joining Supply House.

We appreciate the team's outstanding work and believe that their dedication to this event is a sign of things to come in support of our soldiers, their families, and allies. Good work! I appreciate it!
