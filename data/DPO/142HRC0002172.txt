We appreciate your reaching out to Stryker GBS HR Services. This message is being sent to you because an HR Services case was filed to record your phone conversation about adding your spouse to your dental coverage as a dependent.

The manual form that has to be filled out with the necessary information is attached. Not all of your benefit elections need to be included, since those are already stored in the system; just the new information and the dependent must be included. Kindly attach it to the ticket once you have it ready.
I'm grateful. 

Best Regards,
Leo Schneider | GBS HR Services   America

Hi Shania, 

Alright, I've seen that you filed an event in SAP, and it appears to have been successfully finished and it's perfect. I can also see that your spouse is now enrolled in your independence, but we need the following form completed by you with the dependent's details and the elections they want to be enrolled in before we can enroll him in your benefit elections. Kindly complete the form and return it to me.
With gratitude


Best regards,

It indicates that it got through and was updated on my end! I'm not sure what you're seeing on your end, though.
