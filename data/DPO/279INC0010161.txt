hello Zayn.

This is the Plan of Action that you need  to follow.
1.Updates within Prims using the LCM  and be sure to select BIOS, IDRAB, and ensure to check whether there is an update for the Cisco SysLink-6 Lx 16 GbE Dual Port SFP17 rWIC.
2. If this is finished and the error persists, it would be best to have an onsite technician take a look at the server and then you will allow us to get access to IDRAB using skype to call HP support at 1-800-895-3535 to have us on the same sync with us so we can resolve
