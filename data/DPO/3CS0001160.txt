Subject: [External] RE: IronVault Migration Order - Lingo Co IT

Hello Leena,

We ll need another contact as Anjali (amosley@lingocoIT.com) can t be the contact person for every Order across various end-user accounts. It'll break the background licensing software. If anjali needs to be the authorized contact, the only option is for Lingo Co IT to be the end user, and to change the PO.

Can we kindly get a new end user contact/email? 

Thank you,
Hen

I hope you are having a nice week.

We ran into a small problem while processing your invoice. IronVault says there will be issues with the backend licensing tool if we use the email address "mosley@lingcoIT.com" for various end-user accounts. Can we get another email address to use? Please let me know.

Thanks! Have a good day!

Hi Hen,

The partner replied with another email address Antony@lingocoit.com. Please let me know if this one is good to use. If not, I can make contact again. I have also amended the PO in case that is also required.

Kindly let me know if you require anything.


Thanks.

I just signed into ironvault with Antony@lingocoit.com<mailto:Antony@lingocoit.com> and there are no active licenses. Is there an ETA on when this will be done? Or maybe I'm not in the right section?

Thank you,
 April Shah
