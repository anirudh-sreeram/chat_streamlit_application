Lachlan-

Jaden Gilbert sent an email regarding this matter last Friday. On Friday, Tyrell Hatfield informed us that he won't be able to transfer to our division until 10/18 due to a house closing date. Is there a possibility to modify this now?

Appreciating you in forward for your assistance!
Dylan
