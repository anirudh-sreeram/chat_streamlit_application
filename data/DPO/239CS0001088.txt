Hi Morgan,
The most recent USPS update about the gift cards we ordered is shown below as of today, November 20, 2022. Is there anything else we can do if we don't get them before next week, like purchasing the Flipkart gift cards digitally?

Happy Thanksgiving and thanks for your assistance!

Tell me when I can expect to get these authorized gift cards in the mail.

Activities for Compliance Week are planned for the following week. The winners' gift cards were supposed to be sent the following week. Please notify me if there will be a delay in this.

Thank You!
