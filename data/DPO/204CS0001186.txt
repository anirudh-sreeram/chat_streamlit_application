Currently, we are facing difficulties in assigning the license obtained via the CLOUDSPACE platform to the end user. Although the license appears unavailable for assignment in the Admin Portal, it is active in the CLOUDSPACE platform. In addition, the client's directly purchased licenses with Microsoft are set to expire within the next week.

Could you please provide further clarification on the issue encountered while attempting to assign the license in the Admin Portal? I have verified that the licenses acquired through Cloudspace have been correctly provisioned in Microsoft.

Kindly be aware that the "your products" tab may not always show accurate information in that it will display licenses as "expired" or "not available" even if they are active. Microsoft is aware of this issue and initially stated that it would be fixed, but I have not received any updates on when this fix will be implemented. To obtain a more accurate view of available licenses and reassign them to another user, please go to the Billing > Licenses section.

Regards,
-Jane
