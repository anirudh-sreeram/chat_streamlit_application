I tried, but couldn't complete all the steps
 
1) Able to obtain client logs. which are attached 

2)Unable to obtain console logs. and couldn't find the in options listed , but I can see this in the instructions you sent: 
"Starting with the version 5207 and later, the console logs are a part of the client logs. Hence, collecting the client logs alone can suffice."
Xtrix Workspace on this Bauner computer is version 21.9.0.26.  Do you still need me to obtain console logs?
 
3) Real Timi optimization logs were unable to be generated. I tried the on-screen keyboard and clicked CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + 2, but unable to find the downloads folder in the VDI or on the Bauner computer. This might be because of the issue I have won't allow the call to connect. Steps one & two say to launch the Real Timi application and initiate a call with one of the users which never established, as shown in the screen recording.

4) Issue of the screen recording, also attached (to the email)
 
Please let us know if you need any assistance further

Hello again,
I'm unable send you the logs because I can't obtain the console logs in the first place.
When I followed the instructions, listed here:
https://docs.Xtrix.com/en-us/Xtrix-workspace-app-for-Bauner/troubleshoot.html
Step 1 for console logs says "open Bauner://inspect/#apps". I was able to do this.
Step 2 says "In the Apps tab, click inspect for all Xtrix Workspace-related dove: Sessiondove.html, Main.html"
However, i couldn't find any thng on the page ans its just blank and  I do not even have the option to click inspect. I cant get the logs in this step and cant go next step without completing this .I tried this both in the browser on the VDI, and the browser in Storefront and they both show the same thing..

Thanks much for connecting with us and providing feedback. As Mahesh is out of the office this week so I am handling this case. 

Looking at the internal communications our internal teams have actively worked on the case. We asked to get the new version of XWA installed since it should patch some similar problems and wanted 1) to see if those fixes would help with your issue and 2) if not, then need to work with new version and new set of logs to get the issue fixed

Next we need to gather a new set of logs and won't need to wait for the release of new version. After researching the logs which would fix the issue, we may be able to find a solution. However if there's a bug we'll need to install a new XWA version with that fix.

I appreciate your patience and apologies for the time to get to a solution. Could you please collect a new set of logs and upload them so that I can provide them to our internal team to move toward fixing this problem.

Best Regards,
Rahul Laren

Good afternoon!
Even after updating the Xtrix Workspace app to 21.12.0.19, still got the same error message. When I XWA trying to connect to the Real Timi i can see myself in the camera's preview but while trying to join the call it says  "Sorry, we couldn't connect you."
Can you suggest any other alternative , besides collecting logs and waiting for another version of Xtrix Workspace? As its the 4th Version i have tried but still getting the same error.

Hello!
I am in office to work on this issue still unable to any update on this, as it is managed by Bauner, I don't have any options to update myself. Admin needs to give an update on this but he is currently out of office. I will send an update back when I have an update, and I am trying to get the error to repeat.
Thank you!
