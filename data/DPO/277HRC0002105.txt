Subject: Audit of Internal Union Dues

Team, 
I discovered a flaw in the new hiring procedure after doing a brief audit of Union colleagues who had payroll deductions for dues.
Both the first deduction for union dues and the initiation or transfer fees were not being handled.

We must have you and the associate sign these documents as soon as possible. To enter, please scan and submit to AskHR@Globalfair.com. Kindly CC me so I may mark it as completed.

Up to three deductions will be covered by the form:
1. Continued biweekly dues deduction. This amounts to 2.5 times their monthly hourly income at the moment. The calculation is thus: Current Wage x 2.5 x 11 months / 27 pay periods.
2. Any fees that remained unpaid during the previous ninety days (FEI will absorb that portion of the error if they were recruited more than eighty days ago). The next six pay periods will see this divided up.
3. Transfer/Initiation fees The maximum amount I am evaluating is $60, but FEl is devouring that and many transactions are much more than $60.

Kindly contact Marjorie or me if you have any inquiries.
