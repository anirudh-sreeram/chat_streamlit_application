Hello Group,

Kindly be aware that we cannot amend the manager in the transaction as it is an immutable field. We are only able to rectify the compensation, but we require authorization from Jenna and Darcy, both of whom have previously endorsed it.

Should the necessity for a different manager arise, it may be essential to annul and commence the transaction anew to ensure all particulars are accurate. The same approvals would apply in the event of this course of action being required.

Appreciate your help
Best wishes
Bobby
