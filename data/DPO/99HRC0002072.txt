Can someone at payroll help with the question of the benefits roster and payment for Ms. Willow Hawkins? I haven't heard back from our ROE, so I'm not sure whether she can help.

Good afternoon,

Our records show that Ms. Willow Hawkins was employed on March 14, 22. According to a spokesman from Inter-Local Pension Fund Inc., the organization is still owing the trust fund for Ms. Newton's medical benefits.
Ms. Hawkins was not listed on the roster that the employer provided back to the trust fund, the representative claimed.

We demand that the business contribute right now.

If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to get in touch with our office.

According to our data, I can attest that we started paying monthly CNSI payments for employee Willow Hawkins in June 2022, the month in which she was added to IBT 350 Jin WD. I regret that I am unable to give you copies as proof that we have continuously paid contributions to the Inter-Local Pension Fund for this employee since June 2022 since each employee's SSN is mentioned.

Is the employee claiming that she does not currently have health insurance?

 

On our reconciled June 2022 invoice, we first mentioned this employee and the amount of her payment to the trust. The trust has continued to charge us for Willow Hawkins monthly CNSI donation starting with our July 2022 payment based on the information we submitted with our June invoice.

Also, just so you know, my club does not provide any kind of roster to Inter-Local Pension Fund Inc. The monthly contribution invoice they send serves as a report for all IBT 550 J workers who are covered by this trust. 

If there is anything more I can tell you, do let me know. I've also sent an email to our trust representative to find out why the union rep received this inaccurate information.

Thanks,
