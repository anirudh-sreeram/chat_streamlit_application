Hello Rhodri,

Per our discussion , memory usage is running critical on below server for quite a long time. When we check from VCenter it looks good but there are  some processes that are running in background and using memory on the server. Please have a normal restart of the server. Please provide the downtime window for restart. 

Also server is running with 8GB of RAM. Please check and let us know if this is sufficient for the application or it requires to be increased.

Server name: CBMENT1862
