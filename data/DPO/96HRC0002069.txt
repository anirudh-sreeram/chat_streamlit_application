Can you include the employee ID as a last-minute update to this report?

Thanks!

Welcome Ned,

The employee ID must be included in the payroll summary earnings and taxes and deductions report, as we use this report to balance quarter and year-end reporting.

I would appreciate it if the employee ID could be updated as soon as feasible. I'm working on quarterly and W2 out-of-balances, therefore it would take too long to get this information one by one by Employee ID.


I appreciate your help.
