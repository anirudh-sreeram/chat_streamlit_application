Hi, Morgan

As a result of this being erased and then re-entered into the new PO, you will need to resubmit the debit to the new PO and get the debit below reimbursed.

Have a pleasant day!

Welcome, Savanna
Using this one, how would I proceed? Payment has been made for the initial submission, HDQ6894-180. Should I issue a new entry and only mention it in the new one, or do I also need to get the debit reversed and paid back? They have both cleansed PO#.  
With gratitude

Hi Rubio,

Howard has already debited the invoice that you erased below. You should not delete an invoice for a debit that has already been executed without first speaking with the Recon associate. Instead, please get in touch with Howard.
