Creation date: 2022-12-05 15:43:45 work_notes: User contacted back after being disconnected; after doing so, she was still unable to ping the computer. She tried connecting the computer directly to the wall and bypassing the phone, but the message remained the same. The phone automatically repaired itself, and the user had no other computers available to use as network cables for testing
Creation date: 2022-12-05 15:47:12 work_notes: If you used the cable that came with the PC to check the network, try using the one that came with the phone instead, going straight from the data jack to the PC and avoiding the phone.
If problem continues and booting to automated repair continues, the exact location (building/floor/dept), good callback, send up a ticket.
Creation date: 2022-12-05 15:56:40 work_notes: The user was instructed by ll lory in infra to use the network instead of the phone, either by connecting the phone to the wall or the computer via a cable.
Unable to ping the computer after removing the phone and connecting the network wire to the wall, the user continues to receive the automated repair notice

We have additional computers, and I managed to log in on one of them. so that the ticket can be closed. 

Right now, all I need help with is getting my two monitors adjusted. Instead of just switching between screens, I have to drag my mouse to the outside of the monitor. I know it's a quick fix, but I don't know how to do it.
