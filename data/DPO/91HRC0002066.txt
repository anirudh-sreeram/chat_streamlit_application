A case was opened with a short description of Bobby Bauer's unsubmitted time from hours 3-5 and 3-6 was discovered to be absent from his check. It should have been mentioned on 3-15 that Wellness Day was on
A longer description includes Dear Sir or Madam,

Bobby Bauer's check included unsubmitted time from 3-7 and 3-9 that he had discovered was missing. Additionally, the wellness day on 3-5 should have been added to 3-16, but that is okay because it was previously compensated. I recently requested his time for these days from 3-5 afternoon and 3-6 morning, however I'm curious as to why the system didn't process it. When will he receive payment for these hours, please? Appreciate it!

Good afternoon Gabriella,

Kindly let me know if you are available for a call to discuss what I think to be a time discrepancy on a pay stub.
