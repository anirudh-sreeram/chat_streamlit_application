  Dear  AXEL WHITAKER,

Thank you for reaching to us about Transaction(s) on your card. We are committed to investigate and solve this issue as soon as possible.

WHAT WE REQUIRE FROM YOU

Kindly  give us a completed dispute application form, and make sure that:

  Disputed transactions are recorded accurately
  Your private data is recorded accurately
  Your reason for the dispute is chosen (unapproved charge)
  You sign the application (electronically or physically)

To finalize our investigation, you have to respond to us in 12 days. If we do not hear from you, we will consider this instance solved and closed.

NEXT STEPS

To respond by email, reply directly to this email with the information we requested or if you have any queries related to your dispute. You may attach a document, scan, take a picture of, or screencast the file.

To respond by fax, print duplicates of the information  given above and send them to: 

(423) 299-2301

Dispute Procedure and Solution Timeline

To finalize discovery and solve your issue, the card association network (Vista, MasterCredit, Discovery) has set a time period to allow vendor time to investigate and reply to the case which we have opened for you. This Procedure can last about 20 to 80 days to complete. 

Why does the procedure need 20 80 days?

As your card is not linked to a savings/checking/credit account, this product is not subject to the same terms and conditions as these traditional services. But, we will make  great efforts to resolve the issue as soon as possible. Most of our disputes won't take more 30 scheduled days to get resolved.

Key Reminders

    You will get updated reports at each phase of the dispute inspection, including the final outcome through email if you have provided an email address.
    Once the dispute inspection is done, if it s been found an error happened, the amounts will be put in to your account (card). If the investigation results does not find an error based on the proof of our discovery, your account will not be refunded, and a final outcome will be provided to you  through email.
    If we find that an error has happened, any charges related directly with transaction(s) you have disputed will be credited back upon solution.
    If an email address has not been given the final decision will be sent by physical mail.
    If funds are paid back, they will be ready for use immediately on your active card. If a replacement card is needed and has not been issued to you yet, it will be sent as soon as your dispute is solved. Receipt of the replacement card can take about 6 9 days

Because of your claim of unapproved activity on your account, we have reissued your card as a safety measure. This replacement card will protect your account and prevent unapproved activity from continuing. You must get your card within 14 to 19 business days  for US addresses. 

If you have any queries or need further support related to your dispute, please do not hesitate to reply to this email which will link back to your dispute instance. We will reply  to you in 10 working days. We value your business and appreciate you being a valuable client.

Best regards,

Card Member Dispute Services
