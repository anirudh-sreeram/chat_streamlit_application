Hi

Kindly examine the enclosed documents for this splitting regarding the August 2022 H&W. Notify us of any modification/changes that may be required.

If you concur with the grand total presented in the report, kindly generate a monetary voucher and transmit it to the relevant APSS for further handling.

The password is identical to the one used for your HW report (the union number), and it will stay consistent in the future.


**In the future, kindly include me as a recipient in the email you send to your APSS for payment processing. This will facilitate payment shadow when needed.**


Appreciate you,
