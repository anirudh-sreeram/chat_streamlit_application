Great afternoon,
 
Kindly initiate a support request for Division 3647 as they are encountering issues dialing Argentina. They are receiving a rapid busy signal when making calls. Below is a call example for reference. I am capable of calling it from my mobile.


The call occurred at 2 pm using the number 877-564-5102. The phone provided only emitted a busy signal, with no further response.


Appreciate it,

Hello Willow,

I've included the 3 WAV files, in which you can listen to the audio from the carrier being transmitted back to TLB (identical to the audio/IVR when I call from my mobile). In the audio file from TLB to the carrier, the only sound you can hear is the click when the caller disconnects at the end. Please conduct an inquiry. 

Thank you!

They recently attempted the phone number (877-564-5102) once more and encountered the same rapid congestion signal.

Good Afternoon Willow.

The call instance, enclosed, from the previous day exhibits a standard phone conversation with a 50-second preamble before the BYE/termination. Could you duplicate the problem and furnish particulars? I also activated recording on this connection.

Appreciate!

Brooke, could you please examine these calls to investigate the reason for the failure? The branch reports receiving a fast busy signal when making calls, but I can call from my mobile without any problems.
