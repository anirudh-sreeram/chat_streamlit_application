A case was opened with a short description of FW: Per the CBA case, DE pre-paid paid time off ISC0365796
A longer description includes Hi,
Can you look up the employees status on this ticket? According to the union contract, they were required to receive 56 hours of PTO compensation before taking PTO.
Instead of 56 hours, they were compensated for only 50. What is the situation with the remaining hours?

Thank you,

Hi,
Can you look up the contractors' status on this ticket? According to the union contract, they were required to receive 56 hours of PTO compensation before taking PTO.
Instead of 56 hours, they were compensated for only 40. What is the situation with the remaining hours?

Thank you,

I can verify that Dean and Stevie were each paid for 56 hours, not 40. Luna Lee was the sole employee to receive a 24 hour check because it is what SAP had requested.
Thank you,
Arabella Nguyen
