Hi Charlotte,

I hope your time in SF is fantastic. :)

As part of my refinancing application, the bank is requesting documentation of my compensation, bonuses, and increases.
 - The FY21_Pay Statement doesn't appear to have ever reached me. Can you assist in delivering this because Payroll doesn't appear to have access

Regards
Wesley

Your manager should have the associated statements as payroll does not have access to them.

I would greatly appreciate it.
