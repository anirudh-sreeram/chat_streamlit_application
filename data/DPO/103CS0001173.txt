Creation date: 2022-09-22 18:07:42 work_notes: Have the necessary id's for power BI tickets and attempted to escalate since Vanessa does not have them yet. It says I don't have permission to access or open a request though when I attempt to enter them. Reached out to Michael from Windek about this issue and he said our team is not yet authorized to do this sort of thing so he can handle escalation. Transferring to him soon.
Creation date: 2022-09-22 18:08:24 work_notes: Problem seems to be they are attempting to use the usage reports but the data in them was last updated on 9/8. Need to ask Microsoft to investigate this and figure out why reporting data isn't being updated
