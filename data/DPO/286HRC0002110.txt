Hi Jonty,

Do you know if the onboarding and NDA forms have been completed? Trying to figure out where the process is at.

Thanks,

Hiya Folks,

Is there any progress being made with completing Jed and my onboarding to Flock and your environment?

Thanks!

As a side note, I heard that you were somewhat interested in this while Casey was organising the engagement:

Flipkart Connect received FedRamp High permission as of 10/13. It's the first CCaaS in the field to be warded this demanding level of accreditation. It arrived a month earlier than expected. A blog from a third party will be posted soon by WWPS. On 10/14, we submitted for JM 5/6; once we succeed, we will share once again.
Thanks!

Hi @Jaden Velez <javelez@trellix.com>  did you do this for the other contingent workers from Flipkart or did you get help from someone else?

Hi Tess,

No steps are listed that I can see. NDAs and clearance info has already been sent in by our team.

Thanks,
