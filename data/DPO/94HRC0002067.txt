Subject: Slater, Shane: Incorrect GL Accounts: unable to transfer shifts

Hello,
I've been attempting to shift this worker's time to our container shop. Although he works as a welder in the maintenance department, his official title is maintenance mechanic. He has been fixing boxes for the container department to assist them. When I attempt to transfer his time, I receive the following problem message. Would you kindly inform me if there is another option to transfer his time?
