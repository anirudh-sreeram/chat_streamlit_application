A case was opened with a short description of Frozen WVD Server Re: Techhelix Token #372874  - RE: CS2763481
A longer description includes Even though we can better manage it now, re-opening this issue because it's occurring again. The problem here is that our customer is ready to drop the AVD environment unless we can fix issues like the one presented here. Before I was suggested to open a ticket, here's an email I sent our representative:

Sam, one of our customers primarily works in AVD, and they're seeing a pattern of errors. A user will log out (or try and log back in and they didn't see this problem before) and receive a message once they do that says "Please wait for the Windows Search" on their screen. Once this message appears, their account is locked/frozen, and anyone else who is on that host session that tries to log out will face the same issue. We tried logging them out using Nerdio/Azure, but their accounts are totally stuck and the only way we can get them unstuck is to reboot the virtual machine that the users are using. This means up to 11 users have their accounts locked/frozen from the beginning of the reboot to the end. Nerdio took a horrible 45 to 1 hour to finish, and we've since found that Azure only takes around 10-15 minutes, thank goodness.

The frequency with which this error is happening is making the client think about leaving AVD altogether and move back to their old VPN-based environment, which we don't want. Do you have any thoughts on this? Or could I provide logs to help you learn more? The last time this all occurred was around 9am CST this morning

Thanks for reaching out to Cloudspace Help.  I'm Larry Flores, an analyst with the Cloudspace Structure help team, and I'll be guiding you with why these servers keep freezing when users log out.  Previously, we already looked into the FSLogix Release and you used the current hotfix. If you do not mind, I would like to put this forward and escalate this issue to Microsoft. Could you export the FSLogix profile logs and the event logs of the VM that was affected? I think there is something wrong on the Microsoft end that is causing this issue, since we've already spoken about this exact same problem at least once. It's also becoming more persistent. Since Azure files are being used for the FSLogix profiles, there could be a problem there too.

Kindly also verify/add to the following so we can escalate.

Sure, this can be escalated to Microsoft. I remember we worked together before, but I think I had trouble getting the logs for you (or at least getting them in the requested timeframe). Can you share the process for obtaining logs with me again?

No problem.  I recall the case.  You can get the FSLogix Profile logs from here:  \\IP or Computer Name\c:\%ProgramData%\FSLogix\Logs from another host or server in the Environment. If you are unable to log into the host. Don't worry about the event logs now. I will keep an eye out for the logs and add them to the Microsoft case.

Larry

Subject: [External] [CS2763481] Host freezing due to u... - TracingID#2409770510032501

Good morning Larry,
I hope you are doing well, 
 
Thank you for reaching out to Microsoft Support. I am Ben Whitaker, the UEX Support Professional who will be assisting you with your request. You can contact me using the information in my email signature.

Problem info:  
  Host freezing due to unclean FSLogix log offs

I looked at the details of the case and need your help in understanding the situation better.

Kindly give us the following info: 
  Which operating system  are you using?
  Which FSLogix version do you use? Kindly confirm that FSLogix is up to date FSLogix Release Notes | Microsoft Learn
  Sre you using Antivirus, Firewall or any other? If yes, kindly confirm that you have the FSLogix exclusions: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/sample-circumstances/windows-virtual-computer-fslogix#exclusions-for-antivirus
  How many customers are affected? Kindly share one who was affected so we can analyze the logs.

Also it would be appreciated if you could collect logs by following these additional steps:

1. Download the support tool:  https://aka.microsoft/fslogix_support
2. Unzip the tool and verify registry value data: HKLM\SOFTWARE\FSLogix\Logging LoggingEnabled=2
3. Reproduce the issue by logging in with an affected user
4. As admin, run the FSLogix Support Tool
5. Enter the company name
6. Choose "Gather Rule files", and "Gather Dump Files".
7. Click on "Gather FSLogix Content" (*** Note: This could take a number of minutes***)
8. Once complete, locate the zip file that results from C:\ProgramData\FSLogix\Support and upload it to the workspace for this case.
9. Collect the files listed below from the following path: %SystemRoot%\System32\Winevt\Logs
                  Microsoft-FSLogix-Apps%4Operational.evtx
                  Microsoft-FSLogix-CloudCache%4Operational.evtx
                  Application.evtx
                  System.evtx
                  Microsoft-Windows-VHDMP-Operational.evtx
                  Microsoft-Windows-SmbClient%4Connectivity.evtx
                  Microsoft-Windows-SMBClient%4Operational.evtx
                  Microsoft-Windows-SmbClient%4Security.evtx
Upload all these files to this link: Secure File Exchange (microsoft.com)


I will be waiting to examine these info, and from there, I will generate an action plan to handle your issue and hopefully find a solution soon. 

Kindly let me know if you have any queries or doubts about any of the steps given above. 
 
Thank you for your reply in advance and have a great day ahead.
