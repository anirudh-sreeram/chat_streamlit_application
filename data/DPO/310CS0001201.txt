A case was opened with a short description of Forwarded: Azure login details for GitHub
A longer description includes Hello Help Desk,

We are having issues deploying the main Hopewell Web App from GitHub to Azure. It says the credentials have expired which is why the build is failing.

I used this az cli command to set the secret with Azure credentials per the recommended steps.

az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "HopewellWebApp" --role contributor --scopes
/subscriptions/c48yfres-byfds-45008-v9u5-6cc63db21d32/resourceGroups/webApp
--sdk-auth

The json response in the GitHub secret AZURE_CREDENTIALS was cut and pasted.

But still the GitHub action is failing with this error message:

Az CLI Login failed. Kindly review the login details and ensure az is
installed on the runner. For more details refer
https://aaka.ms/secrets-creation-GitHub-workflows

Can you help or ask your team to help with this problem?

Thank you

The github thread copied here perfectly replicates what you're seeing:

https://github.com/Azure/login-issues/205#issuecomment-2185873160

Does passing the secret as an environment variable help in any way?

Thank you,
Nico
Creation date: 2022-10-07 09:23:15 comments: Hello Nico,

I followed your link and used the command that was suggested there 'Azure/actions/login@V1'

It is still failing but now the error message is a little different:

To generate the credentials I went to the Azure Portal page for the WebApp, opened the az cli and executed the following:

*az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "HopewellWebApp" --role contributor --scopes
/subscriptions/b37eeb7b-c58c-4997-b97a-xxxxx/resourceGroups/webApp

The whole json response was then copied a pasted into the secret:
{
  "clientId": "8ba89f5b-b878-5e5f-9897-8a12d5195633",
  "clientSecret": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",

Creation date: 2022-10-07 10:57:00 comments: Hello Nico,

I made another attempt using the syntax of the original login ( 'uses: azure/login@v1')
and the secret in the Azure cli was updated using this command:

az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "HopewellWebApp" --role contributor --scopes
/subscriptions/b37eeb7b-c58c-4997-b97a-7dd63db21d32/resourceGroups/webApp
--sdk-auth

I now got the following:

: (InvalidAuthenticationToken) The received access token is invalid: at least one of the claims 'puid' or 'altsecid' or 'oid' must present. Please make sure service principal is created properly in the tenant if you are accessing as application. Code: InvalidAuthenticationToken Message:
The received access token is invalid: at least one of the claims 'puid' or 'altsecid' or 'oid' must present. Please make sure service principal is created properly in the tenant if you are accessing as application. 

It seems to be giving a token but the token doesn't have proper access.

Can you see if there is anything in Azure that could be causing this?

Thank you
Creation date: 2022-10-07 12:35:14 comments: Hello Nico,

Could this be related to other access issues that we have encountered this week?

Can we review this together as soon as possible?
Creation date: 2022-10-07 15:26:22 work_notes: 
I will leave this in Nico's queue since this seems to be a break-fix issue.
Nico, taking all other tickets that were raised by the Partner into account, can you verify whether we should continue on this ticket?
Creation date: 2022-10-10 07:40:58 comments: Hello Everett,

I looked at the service principle and it all looks correct to me.

I believe this issue may require Microsoft's assistance, so I will move forward and raise the case with Microsoft and inform you when that is done.

Thank you,

Nico
Creation date: 2022-10-10 09:42:13 comments: Hello Everett,

Sorry for the late response, the case is now open (ID 3320100050000913).

Microsoft  will contact you shortly.

Thank you,

Microsoft requested I attempt deployment with individual credential secrets as opposed to one that is combined.

We see this response when we use individual secrets:

It is not something I have seen before, but it seems it can't connect to the subscription.

Did you return to Microsoft with this error?

You told me that it would be at 10am GMT this morning. We have a business critical issue here with a RED flag which indicates we can operate as a business until we have a resolution. After two weeks of holding, how more urgent can our request be?

Hi Everett,
 
I am really sorry for the late response! 

I am working internally to get an engineer from the Azure Identity Team. They have a high volume caseload at the moment, which is why they have been delayed in getting an engineer that is available.

Kindly know that I am continually checking in with the relevant team to get someone assigned, I will let you know as soon as an engineer is available from the team to assist you further.

Please contact me with any concerns.

Thank you for being patient!

Hi Everett,

Thanks for answering!
 

An engineer has yet to be assigned from the Azure Active Directory team.

You mentioned that you can work outside of UK time. If you would like the ticket to be transferred to next time zone engineer to continue support, please let me know. I ask since I have reached the end of my shift.

Please contact azure.bizu@micorosoft.com if you require immediate assistance during my absence.

Hi Everyone,

I will not be raising the severity of the case since I did not receive verification to do so and CSAM did not advise to do so either.

Please know that this case is still a priority even though we have not raised its severity.

I am working internally to get someone from the Azure Active Directory Team assigned asap to assist with a resolution. I will continue to share updates with you until the end of my shift.

Hello James,

I am very happy to connect with you!

I understand that this issue is very important to you. To keep you updated, I've created an Azure Identity team collaboration to resolve the issue because the issue you're experiencing is not strictly within the scope of the Application Services team.

As you said this has to get resolved today since it's a critical block for you, I will raise the severity to A 24x& since these circumstances are impacting production. Once is an engineer is assigned from the Azure Identity team, I will update you.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or concerns regarding this matter.

I appreciate you for giving us the latest update.

 I am Everett Lewis from Hopewell

This is my number: +44 (0) 6240 339224

To summarize what's happening:
While attempting to deploy an update to our web application, we encountered the error AADSTS8111333: The client secret provided to the application "xxx" expired while executing the GitHub action to deploy to Azure.
We used the information in the link and updated the GitHub secret using the recommended az cli command:
az ad sp create-for-rbac-name "HopewellWebApplication" - Contributor Role - Domains subscriptions/xxxxXxXXX-c69c-4997-c08b-xKXXXXXXxtesourceGroups/webApp-sdk-auth
After updating the AZURE LOGIN details GitHub secret using the json generated by the cli command above, we are now getting this error message. (InvalidAuthenticationToken) The received access token is invalid: at least one of the claims 'puid' or 'altsecid' or 'oid' must present. Please make sure service principal is created properly in the tenant if you are accessing as application. Code: InvalidAuthenticationToken Message:
The received access token is invalid: at least one of the claims 'puid' or 'altsecid' or 'oid' must present. Please make sure service principal is created properly in the tenant if you are accessing as application. 
Nico Howard, our service partner cloudspace, verified that the service principal is valid and the permissions are correct.
