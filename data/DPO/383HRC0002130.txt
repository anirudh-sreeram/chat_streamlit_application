Hi Priya,
I've requested a letter acknowledging the shortfall notice, but HP appears unwilling to give it, as per their email confirmation. Kindly refer to the following correspondence. Can you proceed with this instruction? Kindly include my salary statement for your review, as it details the deficit sum.

Appreciate it,
Mohan

Hi Group,



I don't require any particulars regarding my ultimate statement. I only seek clarification of the deficiency payment. It would be appreciated if you could confirm this through email, specifying the amount I've paid and the date of receipt.


I can, at the very least, send the email for processing. 

Please assist me with this.



Appreciate

Mohan
