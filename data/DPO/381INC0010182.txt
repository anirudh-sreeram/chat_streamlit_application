PC62391 is out of warranty and has a poor USB C port that needs to be  constantly pushed upwards    temporarily, we have a pile of sticky notes on the cable to make it function.

Any chance we can get it changed?

RITM0054067 was opened to change the laptop computer.
Closing the INC per Nikolas's okay.

Just so you know, because the change ticket is now open, I will close the INC ticket so the ticket would not be counted against my record.
