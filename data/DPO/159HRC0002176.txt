It might be simpler to utilize a single unified list, which includes all those mentioned on the 'ALL TO MOVE TAB'.

Appreciate it

Hello Drew

My group won't retrieve job agreements. Nonetheless, I will submit a request to the GBS HRS group to fetch the agreements and forward them to you.

Hanna, could you assign a group member to assist Drew with a project request, please? Examine the Finance, HR, IT, and Legal spreadsheets. The decision is in columns I and J, while columns A-C contain names and employee ID.

Best Wishes
Regan

Hello Regan 

I hope everything is ok with you.

We must transfer several individuals from the TJ legal entity to SNUK, as indicated in the initial attachment/file (reference columns I and J). To accomplish this, we must examine their contracts with our legal department to confirm that no consultation is required. Would you kindly assist by sending all the employment contracts of the highlighted individuals that need to be relocated to SNUK to me and Jack (cc'd) for review?

Best Wishes
Drew
