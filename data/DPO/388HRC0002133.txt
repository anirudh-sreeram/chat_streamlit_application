Hi Lee,



Points 2 and 3 on the list were accomplished as of  (22nd July 2022).

I completed point 2 once again, and the email included two Hyperlinks for NDA that I chose as the international link.


1. Share onboarding documents with resource(s) - The vendor should email the resource the link below so they can sign the necessary (NDA, IPAA, and AUP) forms for Trellix using SignNow. International

   <https://proofpoint.com/v4/__https:/dropbox.com/
   <https://proofpoint.com/v4/__https:/openquire.com.signnow.net/

Is it OK or do we need to use the US/CAN link



Regards,

Krish Cervantes

Hi Krish,



Contingent workers team has indicated that the NDA has not yet been signed, and they have urged me to make sure you are using the most recent link from the email bellow.

Hi ContingentWorkforce,

Is there an update regarding my onboarding request? This onboarding process really needs to get underway since our project depends on the input of this specialist.
