Hi,

Could you please inform me if my phone has been dispatched or currently in the process of being shipped? I would like to know if my number is currently in the process of being ported? Additionally, is it is still possible to obtain a discount for my Amazing phone.

Hi,

I have already made full payment for this order, and I currently have a contract with 07. Why did your third part Mobile Shop cancel my order and charge me for something I did not request. A refund is what I want, rather I would like to proceed with this deal and receive the Ultima tab that comes with it. Can you confirm if it is still on track for delivery, please?

Regards Ms Tina Greer
