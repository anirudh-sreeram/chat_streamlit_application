Good afternoon Peyton,



Please ignore the DAS and asset documents that I uploaded last night to the site for conditional approval on Steward. This morning, I will post fresh DAS asset documents for your perusal.



Thank you!



*Throughout your interactions with me at Astoria Finance Corp, my aim is to deliver outstanding level 10 customer service to you. Please let me know if you ever feel that I am not achieving this so I may make the necessary corrections right away.



*As a friendly reminder, in order to give us enough time to complete your loan, all necessary documents must be delivered eight days before closing or else your closing dare will need to be changed.
