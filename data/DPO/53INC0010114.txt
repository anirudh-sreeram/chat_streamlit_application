A case was opened with a short description of [AD] - [Including in groups - uyhju account]
A longer description includes 1. Application Name: AD
2. Did the user previously have access to this? [Y]
3. A thorough explanation of the request: To carry out daily tasks

for the following groups, kindly give access

SA account : uyhju_30797783

GIS_AD_ManageGroups
GIS_Directoryadmins
IT_Security
OAG-Workstationadmins
Role-SNI-GIS Users


I apologize for the error; in the earlier ticket INC1188460, I neglected to include the SA account
 Hence the groups were added to my personal account. Could kindly use an SA account to replace my personal one : uyhju_30797783
