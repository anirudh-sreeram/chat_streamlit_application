Paige,
I may have registered his termination inaccurately. Can you investigate this situation? I ended his employment, but I couldn't find an option for "death," so I selected voluntary/retirement. I just want to ensure that it's correctly recorded to initiate the process for all death-related benefits.

Hello Paige,



Violet's spouse contacted me today. It appears she deactivated Violet's phone, but it's now reactivated. She's inquiring 
if you or anyone else has attempted to contact her concerning Violet's benefits. She's uncertain about how to access voicemail if you have.

Left a message, and I assured her that I'd investigate and provide her with an update today.



 Appreciate it!
