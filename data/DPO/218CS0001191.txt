A case was opened with a short description of RE: Microsoft Azure issues [NIM5610069]
A longer description includes Hello, I'm trying to create the following support ticket but the submit button isn't functioning.

The problem I'm having is with Azure, as seen here

I'm trying to deploy a Standard_D3_v2 virtual machine in WestUS3 but I'm getting an error message

Error: azureml.core.webservice.webservice: Investigation service deployment has reached a failed terminal state, latest service status: Failed
Activity ID: a87fe940-bbae-4392-9ca5-b13d429f2055
The current sub activity type is unknown, and other records are not available.
Error:
{
"code": "Bad Request"
Status Code: 400,
"message": "Invalid request"
"the details": [
{
"code": "Insufficient deployment resources",
"message": "Unable to program: Post request failed because
Insufficient computational resources. For a given compute target, one replica cannot be created for each specific CPU/memory configuration (6 CPU cores, 18GB memory). You can solve this problem by adjusting the number of copies,
Use a different CPU/memory configuration or use a different calculation Goal."
}
}
}
despite the fact that I created a system resource that matches my specifications. Thank you, Fintan

Creation date: 2022-09-22 09:57:18 comments: Hello Everyone,

Before creating the ticket, the automated diagnostics were run and output the following:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Allocation result
According to the analysis of your deployment, we suggest you deploy an alternate size, or an alternate region. The deployment allocation you are looking for failed with the input parameters: Subscription ID: c47eeb7b-c58c-4997-b97a-6cc63db21d43, region: West US 3, size: Standard_D3_v2, instances: 1 

Based on inputs, the Allocation Success Recommender calculates the chance of success for a particular allocation.  If your allocation is not expected to succeed or is blocked, then Recommender suggests alternatives with better success rates. Recommendations are ranked by their success rate. 

Note: The current release does not support Availability Zone alternative recommendations but are scheduled to feature in the following release.

Alternative deployments

Current Region  Alternate VM Series Alternate VM Size
West US 3 Fv2-series Standard_F8s_v2
West US 3 B-series Standard_B8ms
West US 3 B-series Standard_B12ms
West US 3 Fv2-series Standard_F16s_v2
West US 3 B-series Standard_B16ms


Alternate Region VM Series VM Size
West US Ev3-series Standard_E8_v3
West US F-series Standard_F4
West US Av2-series Standard_A8_v2
West US Dv4-series Standard_D8_v4
West US Dv3-series Standard_D8_v3
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since time is of the essence, it may be worth trying alternatives. I could also raise a ticket with Microsoft, but they may just advise you to do the above.

Can you please suggest on how  would you like me to proceed.

Creation date: 2022-09-22 19:33:15 comments: Hello Bruno,

That is good to know. I'd like to run the diagnostics myself. Could you forward me a link to Allocation Success Recommender? Can you also raise a ticket with MS in the event they can provide additional advice?

Thanks,
 Fintan.

Unfortunately, I can't link to it since it is just one of the steps to raising a support ticket. 

I will create a support ticket for you now and update you with the ID once it is done.

Thanks Monica, you have helped me a lot. That fixed the problem. But now I get 
 
"message": "Kubernetes Deployment failed",
  "details": [
    {
      "code": "CrashLoopBackOff",
      "message": "Error in entry script, FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/var/azureml-app/main.py', please run print(service.get_logs()) to get details."
    },
 
Which is also a very obscure error
 
Any ideas?

Recommendation

We understand that your desired VM size in subscription c47eeb7b-c58c-4997-b97a-6cc63db21d32 could not be deployed.
Deployment restrictions exist to account for numerous business and technical constraints, such as capacity limitations. We are really sorry for any inconvenience and how it may have affected you. We are always working on expanding coverage to accommodate many sizes in as many locations as possible.

Recommended Steps

Please use the following to identify SKU restrictions and quota limitations for your subscription: 
  To list all sizes that are available for deployment for subscription c47eeb7b-c58c-4997-b97a-6cc63db21d32, execute the Azure CLI command az vm list-skus to check for the VM sizes available by region and the deployment restrictions that may exist on the VM size. If the size you desire is marked NotAvailableForSubscription or is unlisted, please see the steps in Troubleshooting region or SKU subscription issues in order to submit a request for accessing the SKU size.
  To view the quota usage for subscription c47eeb7b-c58c-4997-b97a-6cc63db21d32, use the Azure CLI command az-vm-list-usage. For each subscription, in each region, quote limits are enforced at two tiers. Theh first tier is the Total Regional vCPUs limit while the second tier is the per VM Series vCPUs limit. If you are unable to deploy your desired size as a result of a quote limit, please see the steps in Quota increase requests in order to submit a request for increasing the limits.

Recommended Documents
  
  To determine sizes available by region for your subscription using PowerShell, execute the Get-AzComputeResourceSku command, for Azure CLI see the az vm list-skus command, for the REST API see the Resource SKUs - List operation.

Please allow me some time for the investigation. I will review the issue from azure end and get back to you.

If you have any concerns regarding the above or if additional information is needed, please let me know.
 
My working hours are from Mon to Fri 10:00 AM to 7:00 PM IST, please let me know if you have questions/concerns.

Thanks for giving me all that info.
 
I have a couple of questions regarding this.
 
1. Is the VM deployed, or are you facing problems during deployment.
 
2. What is the purpose of this deployment.
 
3. Is this script for one VM, how many VMs deployment is happening.
 
4. Are you attempting to deploy Kubernetes VM.
 
5. Would you mind sharing the script with me, so can review and investigate further.
 
Please let me know if you have any concerns on above or if additional info is needed.

Kindly, let me know whether my understanding is correct or Incorrect?

My working hours are from 8:00 AM - 4:00 PM EST, because of the time zone difference I have assigned a call for us for tomorrow at 8:00AM EST that will be at 1:00 PM BST for you. Kindly let me know if that works for you or you can reschedule for some other time. This call will help me familiarize myself with your issue and work out the best solution.
I will wait for your response and can adjust my time to connect with you. 

Thank you,

I hope everything is good.

The deployment problem has now been resolved but we are currently waiting for CSAM to guide the customer in the right direction to get more support on different topics.

I will keep the customer in the loop.
Thanks ,

Now that this particular problem has been resolved, do you want me to go ahead and close this case?

I see you sent an email to support about setting up Kubernetes, and that should solve this problem. I have told Harper that you want to call to resolve that problem.

Kind Regards
Bruno
