A case was opened with a short description of Use Mailmate Login
A longer description includes I m not sure if you can assist with this, but I have a user who can log into OWA, I recently reset her password, but Mailmate will not connect on her IOS phone nor on her desktop. She has a Business Standard license and the most recent version of Microsoft Office installed. She has no issue accessing the web, but when I try to set up a new profile in Mail, it asks for login credentials and never accepts them.

This should not be a policy driven issue because this started on Wednesday or Thursday of last week. Unless MS changed something, I should have other people reporting similar problems then, but I only see her reporting problems.

Any assistance is greatly appreciated.

Thank you for getting in touch with Cloudspace Support. Could you please confirm the client's name as well as the affected user name?

As we have seen a recent multitude cases like this, the issue could have been caused by Microsoft's Depreciation of Basic Authentication. Let us first try running Diag: Enable Basic Auth in EXO" (you can click the blue button) from this article: https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/u6/exchange-team-blog/basic-authentication-and-exchange-online-june-2021-update/cb-q/3565938

It also describes how to use Powershell to re-enable SMTP Auth and you can find that method here:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/authenticated-client-smtp-submission#disable-smtp-auth-in-your-org

Please respond to this case or reach out to us at 1-855-995-8309, we are available to assist you 24/7.
Thank you and have a wonderful day,

I m not sure if you can assist with this, but I have a user who can log in to OWA, I recently reset her password, but mailmate will not connect neither on her IOS phone nor on her desktop mailmate. She has a business standard license and the most recent version of Microsoft office installed. Web access is fine, but when I try to set up a new email account, it asks for login credentials and never accepts them.

It should not be policy driven as this started on Thursday or Friday of last week, unless MS made a change then I should have others with similar issue, but I only see her having this issue.

Any help is greatly appreciated.

A bit further down in the SMTP AUTH article (which has the shell powershell cmds), it demonstrates how the feature can be enabled for just one user account, rather than the entire organisation.
It reads, " Set-CASMailbox -Identity vera@rhodo.com -SmtpClientAuthenticationDisabled $false"
