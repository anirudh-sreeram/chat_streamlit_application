Hi Manasa,

Thanks for your help. 

Screen share request has been raised for the help desk to remotely control my computer. But I need to use the Teams desktop app to let other participants access my computer. This feature is enabled when running the desktop version of Teams but not the web version. As I use my personal laptop while working, I cannot access the desktop Teams to let in remote control access.
 

Thanks,

Manasa
