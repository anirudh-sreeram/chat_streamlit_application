Hi! 

Thanks for your help! There can be high CPU Utilization because AV is running a 'Full Scan.' Is 5GB the recommended by PowerPop when Anti Virus is run with real time protection? If that's not the case, increasing RAM usually helped previously.

@Kevin Aryes   What do you expect in accordance with this request? The Anti Malware Executable is utilizing only 54.3 MB of RAM, so it doesn't look like that should be the exact issue.

Hello Bernard and Team, 

What is the OS this server is running? 
What's the RAM GB allocation now?
