Subject: RE: REIMBURSEMENT


Hello Ben
        this is not an JD customer refund.  Refunds to JD customers will begin with the number 3000 for checks, or 4000 if the transaction was made using an ACH.  Also if you detail the check you will see that the payment function says "Payables disbursement" our JD customer refunds say "onetime payment request from Payables" and last if you look at the Paid invoice.  One's that come thru JD are going to have RPY followed by PY, I, CM, PA, etc. The branch, account, DDREFF, and mthyr will be present if it is a due diligence one.  I believe these would need to go through customer service to handle reissue.


Many Thanks
