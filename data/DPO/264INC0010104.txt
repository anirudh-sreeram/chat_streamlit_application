Albus has not yet rebooted his system although he said he will do it before leaving EOD. I'll check it again on Sunday.

I have advised Albus to perform a complete shutdown of his system, then restart it and log in. After that, reset branch and extension then attempt another call to Virgin Islands. If this is successful he will have the branch TMs reboot their computers.

Passwords have been changed for each Extension and User extension to 9031 and rebooted the IPO. Next I had Rama Cidem load the new 5 digit script. The problem was not solved by this.

Subject: Possible Virgin Islands CLASS CTD calling issue?

Ria   My team sent this note to me so I would like you to check the CLASS Phone number table to make sure that this is allowed to be called in CLASS CTD?

Just now, I contacted the BM in 6473 and when he calls the number (340-163-6014) via click to dial he gets a waiting for line and 3 beeps then 3 beeps again which goes on till he hangs up. He has no trouble manually dialing the number from his desk phone. He states this happens with every number for Virgin Islands cell customers residing in his area. This does not seem like a SIP issue but rather something with CLASS. I spoke with Yeason and we think the numbers are probably not loaded in CLASS. Ulele, what are your views on this?

Good afternoon,

I am checking again to see if you have had a chance to test? Kindly inform me if issues are still persisting for you when you call Virgin Islands and if so kindly send call samples with the customer's 12 digit phone number, what happened and the time of the call.

Creation date: 2022-11-10 21:55:35 work_notes: Micky and I checked the differences between calls to Virgin Islands made using CTD and manually in 6473. An CTD call just states "waiting for line" and stays on line till the caller hangs up. A manual call, on the other hand, goes out right away and without any issues. I will order a new IP Office just to prevent this issue. It won't be replaced until after CAD. When we replace the IP office, I will create a new ticket.

Good morning,

Ricky, you have the option to cancel the branch's request for a new IPO. The ARS table includes a few entries that I identified as the cause of the problem and deleted them.  At the end of Thursday, I did a test with the branch, and they are now able to use click-to-dial to call Virgin Islands numbers.

Thank you,
