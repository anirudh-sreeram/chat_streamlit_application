Great Day Roy,

I appreciate your reference Letter, but I've noticed two adjustments that are necessary.


  *   My formal departure date is November 29, 2022, and not November 27.
  *   I did not provide guidance to the MEA Cluster. That responsibility was solely undertaken by Sam.

Normally, our Swiss Reference Letter concludes with a company "Appreciation."
In a similar vein:

 "We want to seize this moment to express our heartfelt gratitude to Ms. Vipin for her significant input to Stryker and extend our best wishes for her continued success in her future professional pursuits.

Could you kindly include this as well?"

Our recommendation letters also require HR's signature. Could you kindly include Dante Cantu, as Joel requested yesterday? 

I appreciate you a lot and best regards.

Riya
