Subject: FW: Pay stubs

This may be a conversation about payroll, but I wanted to include @Larsen, Karl for his perspective and the possible opening of FAQs about weekly pay and the effects that it might have due to changes in taxes/etc.


Karl -  any advice?

Please look over her pay stubs she is concerned about the mismatch. I saw that $7.98 was taken out of one paycheck for federal taxes. On the other check, please thank $58. I'm not sure.

Claire was transferred from All American Waste to Waste Connection Services Customer Service East as of 8/22. Each firm is a separate entity within the IRS, therefore whenever an EE changes companies, their tax elections are wiped away and they must submit fresh tax elections. The greatest tax status possible for Claire is single with zero dependent allowances because she failed to complete tax elections. Please ask Claire to complete any necessary new tax elections.
Claire HRBP seemed to have told her about these changes as they ought to have gotten a notification outlining them and how they would affect their workers.
I am grateful for your help!
