Good Morning Nora 
                Yes we updated on our Sales Tax Exemption Letter  Form 4839 such as:  new contact  number & added website information.


1. This is HOW we want it to be printing &  we are trying find out who can help correct it:
 

2. Currently it is printing "overlapping the old & new info"  these are the letters that are were requested through ZOHO from the customer's account through:
    BP Maintenance >  Forms Menu >  General Correspondence > Sales Tax Exemption Letter.     I think that these letters would be downloaded at the end of day & printed

 

3. Our original form has only this info:
 


I hope these screenshots are helpful to you with my explanation. Please let me know if you have any other questions which I will be glad to help with.

Thanks
