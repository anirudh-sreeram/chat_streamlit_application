Hey Ross,

Normally I (Home) drive is restricted to 8 GB capacity as per governance policy for each customer. How many customers you want to verify with I drive's property details?

Hello Ross, 

Linux does not give right details for Home drive through Drive properties, because the properties are set on NAS box in the background.

@Tegan Mccoy @Mercedes Briggs For the mentioned customers in the list given below can we get the Home drive usage capacity ?

Hello Kasey,

Yes, I cannot see the same home drive utilization for the customers on the google chrome.

@vBlock team   Because we cannot see the S3 storage console to confirm the quota information, Could you please let me know the quota size allocated to below customers home drive folder along with their current usages?
