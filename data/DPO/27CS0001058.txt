Hi Huchi,

Thank you for reaching out, and I offer my sincere apologies for the delays. Please be aware that gift cards are sent via regular mail in a white envelope. Typically, it takes 7 to 10 business days for gift card orders to be delivered. However, please understand that delivery time may vary depending on your location. Therefore, we recommend allowing up to 21 business days for delivery.

Your order was dispatched on October 11th. If it hasn't arrived by November 12th, kindly notify us, and we will initiate the devaluation process for your cards and the return of your points.

If you have anymore questions or require further assistance, Please feel free to respond within the next 72 hours or initiate a new life sync request.


Warm regards,

Amir
