Hello Lyla,


We require a copy of your updated insurance certificate for Errors and Omissions and General Liabilities for our seller administration.  Kindly let me know if this is something you can handle, or have a contact from whom I can request it.  Thanks.

I wanted to ask if you got the information from our Lender Services Department.  I didn't get any emails just wondering if you got a call from someone?
