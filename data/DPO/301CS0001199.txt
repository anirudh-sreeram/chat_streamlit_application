A case was opened with a short description of Transfer the company from one InnovaTec cloud to Nimbus cloud
A longer description includes Good Morning,

We recently took over an organizations IT support, and their servers were already configured with InnovaTec.

Is it possible for us to move this company to the Nimbus cloud and take over billing?

In InnovaTec, the name of the company is Industrilink LLC
The reseller at the moment is idsU

Sincerely,
John

It appears to be related to the previous ticket which you raised of the same nature that returned you to John.

@Nimbus Support<mailto:support@nimbus.com>   kindly re-open this ticket and escalate to InnovaTec and let them know a customer needs to be switched between providers?

if this is simply not possible on your end, please let us know and I will take over.

Thank you
