Creation date: 2022-10-19 17:25:53 comments: Hi Okany,

I acknowledge your request to cancel the Ludul Business Backup + Email Archiving service. However, during the processing of the order, an error was encountered. While investigating this issue, I noticed that there was an initial order for Ludul Business Backup, followed by an order for Ludul Business Backup + Email Archiving. Were you attempting to upgrade to the Archiver service? Normally, this can be done smoothly by using the upgrade button, but if a cancellation and reordering process is followed instead, it can potentially cause complications on your end. When an order for backup is canceled and then an order for the archiver is placed, certain backend adjustments need to be made by us in order to ensure that your account functions correctly.

Please inform me of how I can be of assistance to you. If you wish to upgrade to Ludul Business Backup + Email Archiving, I can explore the possibility of converting your account and subsequently canceling this ticket. If you would like to retain the backup service, we can reactivate your account; however, please note that you would need to reorder Ludul Business Backup through the Cloudspace platform. If you intend to proceed with the cancellation and have no plans to reorder, kindly let me know.

Time sensitivity may be a factor in this matter, so I hope to receive your response soon. Feel free to inform me of any specific requirements or further assistance you require.

I wish you a wonderful day ahead.

I would like to proceed with canceling the subscription because it is not functioning correctly.

I am actually interested in utilizing the Ludul + email archiving for Mixo. 

Could you accommodate this request and provide the necessary 15 licenses for it to work?

Thanks,

Ludul successfully reestablished and upgraded your account to the archiver level. The next step is to request your permission to proceed with the deprovision cancellation. Kindly respond to this message with the following statement:

"I, (first/last name) of Oryian, approve and request Cloudspace to cancel the deprovision ticket for Mixo PC of Ludul Business Backup + Email Archiving effective 10/18/2022."

Once you have completed these steps, please proceed to place an order with the selected archiver and the corresponding 15 licenses. Once the order has been processed, you should be all set. 

If you have any additional questions, please feel free to let me know.

Thank you for your cooperation and your time.

Thank you for providing clarification. According to the information I have in the Ludul portal, there are currently 15 licenses associated with the subscription. In order for the subscription to appear in the Cloudspace platform, you will need to adjust the number of licenses required for this organization. To proceed with closing out this case, I kindly request your permission to cancel the deprovision ticket. Kindly copy and send me the following statement.

"I, (first/last name) of Oryian, approve and request Cloudspace to cancel the d provision ticket for Mixo PC of Ludul Business Backup + Email Archiving effective 10/18/2022."

Once I get this statement, I will be able to close the ticket.

Thank you for your cooperation and your time.
