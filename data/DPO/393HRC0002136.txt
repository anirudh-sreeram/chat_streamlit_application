Hi Jenna



I've included a signed authorization document from happy sites. We are handling a transfer cost with his prior Local. We'll let you know if the amount of the Due's or the initiation changes.



In the interim, it would be excellent if he could be included in the September billing. If not, kindly inform us.









Respectfully,
