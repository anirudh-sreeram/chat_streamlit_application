Hello Linda,

We did not enable database Audit for DDL or DML operations on this server , so we can not find if the records removed from the table.
We can verify , we have not received any request to remove the records from this DB server.

Warm Regards,
Cai

Below issue does not point out what specific DB error you are running into other than "INSERTEXCEPTIONRECORD - Store Procedure failed". We require better detail on what that exception code "ABBServices_0004" is telling.

Best Regards,
Amanda

Hi Hasan/DBA,

We would also like your team to check the DB logs and see if we have any timeouts logged for 3/31 between 12am -1pm

Can you also check why the stored procedure INSERTEXCEPTIONRECORD is failing?
