Subject: REQUESTS FOR REINSTATEMENT: 4 CERTS

Hi,

These 4 Certs had Construction Extensions but Cert wise, they were not Ordered that way.
Loan Close Dates are in the enclosed Excel Spread.
The Records, Fee Histories, & Certs for all 4 are the enclosed PDF s.
Kindly suggest Deposits required for each LPMI & BPMI Cert for Prior Due so they all are Current & Next Due for Dec.
