Hello There!

Edwin referred me to you. I've attempted to reach out to Paywish Select online three times but haven't received any response.
 I opted for active Favorites vouchers worth  180.. However, while at Decathlon, one of the merchants listed on the card, I was informed that the vouchers are fraudulent and there are ongoing lawsuits involving Paywish Select and Decathlon.

I had intended to use the vouchers at Decathlon to purchase school clothes and trainers for my son. However, I had to pay for the items using my bank card and left the store feeling utterly embarrassed.

I would appreciate it if my balance could be transferred back so that I can choose a different card or store. Considering how close it is to Christmas, this  180 would have been immensely helpful. I truly hope to hear from you soon and am hopeful that you can assist me promptly.


Best regards
