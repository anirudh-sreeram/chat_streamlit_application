After this ticket/task SCTASK6205720 was closed, it meant to generate another task for the end user experience, but it didn't. Would you kindly have someone to install it? 

I am adding Rashi in this thread so that she will be aware of the issue. 

Best regards,

Good Morning. I have a ticket to install IBM Rational Developer Cobol Energy Device License 8.6.6 onto your computer P547431.  I have no idea when the install will be finished, and I don't have a license number in case one is required.
Creation date: 2022-11-11 16:34:09 work_notes: [8:55 AM] Sushmita Bakshi
Alright I'm searching the folder for the license associated with this issue, but I can't seem to find it for that particular install. The misunderstanding is that.

are you referring to INC5597660

[8:56 AM] Sushmita Bakshi
Yes sorry

[09:02 AM] Jevy Yuin
what I should do is contact the TM and see if they really need the IBM Rational Developer Cobol Energy Device License 8.6.6  or if they just want the   BD Analitic   or both.  

[09:04 AM] Jevy Yuin
Peri did purchase a license for it ... so she should have that information.

Hi, Ravi.   Actually, I have to go for a little time since I have to pick up my spouse from the hospital after some tests.   Can I call you on Teams?  Might be easier to discuss.

[8:53 AM] Rakhi Ghosh
Could I give you access to my PC when I leave?  

[8:54 AM] Sushmita Bakshi
We can do this any time that works best for you. Please look after your husband.  

[8:54 AM] Rakhi Ghosh
Is it something you can do while I"m away from the computer?  IN that case, it might be perfect if you do it now.

[8:55 AM] Sushmita Bakshi
The problem is that I'll lose connectivity and global protect will time out.

Can you look at this ticket please INC5597660.  Sia assigned it to me to install a program from S:\IST\Common\ BD Analitic  folder. 

[09:49 AM] Akash Rawat
Is the software in the vault too

[09:52 AM] Sushmita Bakshi
Not that particular name; right now, I'm searching through every folder.
[09:53 AM] Akash Rawat
Contact Sia and let her know that it is not in the vault.

[09:56 AM] Sushmita Bakshi
Sia also made sure the vault had that installation, but it wasn't there. According to what Sushmita previously informed me, if it is not in the vault, I cannot install it. I understand what the ticket clarifies but I am on a thin wire here and do not want any reason for them to let me go. The software will need to be in the vault to be installed.

I apologize for the wait. The software is nowhere to be found, and the folder mentioned is not the one I am permitted to access. As soon as I find out the details for the installation, I'll let you know. Sorry.

I am waiting on Cobol to be installed.   BD Analitic failed I will try again

[11:48 PM] Rakhi Ghosh
I was wondering if  BD Analitic needs to the rational IDE to be installed first?  It runs in that IDE, as I recall.

[11:50 PM] Sushmita Bakshi
If that is the case you will need to submit a Request RITM for IDE and  BD Analitic to be installed together.  If you just ask for IDE I am concerned that the  BD Analitic will be forgotten.  I am trying it again after the Cobol installation. 

[11:51 PM] Rakhi Ghosh
You are also installing the IDE (RDi), yes?  I didn't actually make any of the requests, so pretty confusing on what was asked and what the process is.  Sorry!

[11:52 PM] Rakhi Ghosh
My understanding is that both the Cobol and  BD Analitic are actually plugins that run within the Rational Developer for i IDE (RDi).  For what that's worth.

[11:54 PM] Sushmita Bakshi
No the IDE/RDi exists in the ticket at all.  This was sent from the original that did not make the task requests for installations.  I am not sure what we can do now.  

[11:55 PM] Sushmita Bakshi
I am asking my management team

I think you have to have RDi installed before you install the  BD Analitic. since the  BD Analitic is an eclipse plugin for RDi.

Good morning, Ravi.   Is the request you already worked on INC5597660, where you're trying to get the  BD Analitic and Cobol licenses installed?

On Thursday, I emailed Varun Jones, explaining our predicament (can't find a request for RDi).  She's the one Aman Williams said I should contact.  She hasn't replied yet.  I'll contact her again soon and let you know.  I'll also cc you there.

Subject: RE: Getting DVGGC and RDi up and running on my laptop

Good morning, Purnia.  

I have added Sushmita Bakshi to this thread since she s working on the request to install the Cobol and  BD Analitic plugins on my PC (request # INC5597660) .  However, without having Rational/Liposaed IDE and the RDi plugin on my PC, they won t install.  

Is there a request to install the Rational/Liposaed IDE and the RDi plug-in on my PC and, if so, what is that number?  Or, how can I submit one?  I do see that RDz is available to request through the self-service portal, which probably does include the Rational/Liposaed IDE.  Should I begin making out a request for that, or is that something you would do?

Thanks very much for your assistance on this!

Hi again, Purnia.  

Following up on this thread, Sushmita Bakshi tried installing Cobol and  BD Analitic for which she has a request, but because RDi is not installed on my PC, they would not install (they are plugins for RDi).   She doesn t find a request for me for RDi.  It is definitely not installed on my PC.  I don t find RDi in the self-service portal, either.  

I checked with Aman and he checked with Rick Smith; they suggested I check back with you.  Can you help us figuring out what happened to the request for RDi and how we can get it back into the system, or start a new one?  I would have tried through the self-service portal if I could have found the product.  Sorry to  disturb you!

Thanks!

Hi, Constance.  Lucky
Drones recommends you as the person to help me solve my DVGGC issues and get RDi installed on my laptop.

The issues I am having:

  I do not have authority to get into the latest DVGGC folder (S:\IST\Common\Access_L_Client_Solution\ClientSolutions).  I get the message that I am disallowed from using that resource when I try.
  I was using a different folder (S:\IST\Common\CLASS\Client Solution\Client Solutions), clicking the LaunchDVGGC.bat.  
o It would take as much as 20 minutes to finally bring up the first page.  
o But, today again I gaced the error: N:\Packages\Windows\ClientSolutions\dvggclaunch_win-64.exe The system cannot find the drive specified.  
  I need RDi which is not on my PC yet.  Can you tell me how I can get that?  
o I checked out the self service portal and find the IBM Rational Developer licenses.  They have big price tags.  Should I be requesting the IBM Rational Developer Websphere and IBM Rational Developer Cobol?


Thanks for any advice you can provide!

Hi, Purnia.   

I am able to access the IST/COMMON folder. But, the folder I was given for Access Client Services--DVGGC (S:\IST\Common\Access_L_Client_Solution\ClientSolutions) isn t in the Common folder.  I think Aman mentioned that he wasn t able to access that Access_L_Client folder, either.  

Is S:\IST\Common\Access_L_Client_Solution\ClientSolutions the correct folder you want me to acess?   Or could you please let me know the most recent version of DVGGC?  I noticed that there is an DVGGC folder under IST/Common. In fact, I copied that to my local computer and, when I start it from there, it seems to be working quite well. So, I might be all done for setup as long as that IST/Common/DVGGC folder is the official latest version of DVGGC. 

Thank you for your generous support!
