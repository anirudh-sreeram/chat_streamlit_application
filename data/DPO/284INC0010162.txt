Hi Sarah/Eric,

Can you please provide an update on this? As F: (data) drive is 98% used currently and we are getting similar tickets for the same.

You should see ticket INC0932141 in your queue.

@Sarah J. Woods

Hi Sarah, could you please open a ticket with Itron assista.ne.about how to address this error? Rather than adding space  we need to clean up task or index step to red.ne.this database drive footprint.

Thanks,

Stuart

Hi Eric,

Good Morning!!,
tsmwnt1350  is a DBMS server. LT_Prod database is on this server. You can find the current size of the LT_prod DB tables in the table details chart I sent you. We have DB auto-growth enabled on MongoDB DBs. An auto-growth event is the process where the MongoDB Server engine increases the size of a database file when it runs out of space  This includes data file auto-growth and log file auto-growth. But for auto-growth process, we need to have space available in Data Drive (F). 97% of the space on the F: drive is being used. Therefore, we got to have an incident. To avoid an incident, 16% of the drive space needs to be available.



Thanks & Regards,
Abhi Sharma

Good Morning,

Thanks for the update.  Could you provide some explanation for a non DBA?  In each table, it seems like many of them do not have much tablespace available.  In the example below, does it mean that a table is using more than 64 GB of table space  so that there is only 9.6 megabytes of datafiles available?

KZWarehouse Endpoint_HETDeviceAttribute 1648323346 60561.42 9.65 64690.39

Does the tablespace automatically increase as needed until the file system is filled up?

Thank You!
