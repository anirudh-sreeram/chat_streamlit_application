A case was opened with a short description of Query from supervisor - Staff Recommendation ***refer to notes***
A longer description includes Hello

I think the response is negative, but I didn't want to assume, so I thought I'd inquire.

Appreciate it.

I was unaware of this. Is it possible to modify it now? Erin Wright initially presented the job to Ali, but he listed me as reference  because I was the one he was in contact with regarding the position at the time. I appreciate the update.

Great Day Ines,



I recently reviewed my payment records and it seems I have not received the $1100.02 referral bonus for Rohan Edwards, even though he is marked as my referral. There is no documentation of the payment in my records. I would be grateful if you could assist me in finding the correct information.



Appreciate you.
