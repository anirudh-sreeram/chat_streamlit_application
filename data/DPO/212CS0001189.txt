A case was opened with a short description of E-mail delivery issues with applications sending through smtp.office365.com with authentication
A longer description includes Hello,
MGR Is currently facing an issue with mail delivery as one of its applications attempts to send messages to smtp.office365.com while authenticating with the account van@mgrplace.com.
Some messages are being delivered while others are not. The issue started yesterday, and the message trace does not provide comprehensive details. Even the SMTP authentication mail flow report is lacking in details.
Is there a method for reviewing SMTP logs to determine if Microsoft is rejecting a message at the SMTP level.
We need to verify whether Microsoft is rejecting the message, such as due to a lack of handshake, etc.

Could you give me a call to discuss? I believe communication through e-mail may be slower.

It was a pleasure talking to you today. I have generated a ticket with Microsoft and included an article on utilizing direct send or a connector for your application:

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/best-practice-for-mail=flow/how-to-set-up-multifunction-device-or-application-to-send-email-using-ms-365-or-office-365
Creation date: 2022-10-14 23:56:38 work_notes: Rory experienced multiple failures when SMTP messages were sent to his application. SMTP was previously enabled on the tenant, and he faced the problem today. Contacted MS for support and also recommended considering either direct send or creating a connector for the application.
Creation date: 2022-10-15 03:28:34 comments: Yes, It is compatible.
