I have another request here about the partnershell order. We're getting an error though that says an email already exists. Can you remove the existing email on the partnershell please? We will then try this again.

Thanks & Regards,
-Richard

Hello Richard, 

This error seems to be occurring since Bruno ordered the NFR and then the name on his account was changed. I have escalated this case to our provisioning team.

Thank you,

Hello NoteValet Team!
 
A starPRT - NoteValet NFR is failing while trying to provision. 

An internal server error with status code 500 occurred. Has there recently been problems with accessing the portal?
  
I'm trying to resolve this error but am having trouble figuring out where to start.

Thanks for your time and have a good day.
