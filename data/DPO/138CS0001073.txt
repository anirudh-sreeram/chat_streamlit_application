Greetings Mr. Vaughn,


I just tried the code to redeem the gift voucher but it didn't work for me. Now, I was banned due to multiple attempts. I am sorry for that. Can you kindly help me with this issue?

Thanks in advance,

Keenan

Description

The Clinton Leadership staff would like to recognize Keenan for his keen attention to detail. While assembling an BC 4118 Kennan observed the 9241-4 for the 2B Bearing was incorrect. The serial number on the bearing part did not match the serial number listed on the 9241-4. Thanks to Keenan's attention to detail and timely alert, a wrongly documented part was not installed in an engine that would have negatively impacted its quality.
