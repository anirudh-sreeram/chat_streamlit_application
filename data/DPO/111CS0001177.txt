A case was opened with a short description of Wildegard Services - Customer Migration   Acquisition
A longer description includes Hi,

We are attempting to onboard a customer into Cloudspace with Turnover but received a message saying that the client domain is already affiliated with another account and we cant create it. I assume that MSP we are taking over an account from is using Cloudspace. Can we go ahead and create the client account? If so what info is shared with the other MSP?

Creation date: 2022-10-12 14:39:54 comments: Hi Dexter,

Hope you are doing well. In this case the migration will be handled for you by us. We first obtain approval from the release and acquisition providers. Can you verify the domain for the company that is being migrated?

Thanks,
Amara
Creation date: 2022-10-12 14:43:49 comments: Can the other MSP see who it will be transferred to or do they only see that a transfer request was submitted? It doesn't really matter either way but we would like to know what the other end is expecting. That way, we can tell them what to watch out for.

We did not disclose the acquisition partner to the MSP. Kindly let me know if you have any other  queries, problems, or concerns. If you want to proceed with the migration, we need to verify the domain first. 

Thanks,

Migration will include the services. Let me know if you want to go ahead with this migration. 

Thanks,
Amara
Creation date: 2022-10-12 16:26:06 comments: I thought all the services they provide are being removed. We might have retained the Microsoft licensing but only that one. Either way, we aren't signed up as a partner with Microsoft so our customers are being charged directly through O365.

The domain is wildegardservices.com

I thought I would give the other MSP the opportunity to remove those services before we migrate. Is that not recommended?

I understand. We can wait for the release MSP to cancel their subscriptions and delete the company if we aren't going to migrate any subscription. We can reclaim the domain after the company is deleted so you can build out the company then. Please reach out if you have additional queries, problems, or concerns.

Thanks,

For tracking, please append "Customer Transfer   Acquisition" to the Short Description
Checklist as Word doc: https://cloudspace.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/ServiceDesk/EU9pbrwaL2NMrXXyy9DumsegdkyZkhH8wJp4A1FuYSOxl36A?e=xcC2NO

Verifying items:

  Create Deskflow
 tickets for acquisition approval from "winning" Partner (if it does not already exist)
   Generate Deskflow
 case for release approval from "losing" Partner (if it does not already exist)
  Add the "losing" Partner ticket to the "winning" Partner ticket by adding the "losing" ticket number in the Parent field in Deskflow
 on the "winning" Partner's ticket
  Select the Primary Partner Administrator as a starting point to approve an acquisition/release
   Add CAM for losing Partner to Deskflow Watchlist
   Verify active services in Cloudspace Platform
   Depending on the active services, determine whether the "winning" Partner has an appropriate Partner Shells configuration
   Look for the customer's name in the One Time Charges section to determine if there are any services offered under the Partner's shadow company
   If the customer does not have active services, ask the "losing" Partner if the customer can be removed from their account on the platform,  rather than authorize the transfer
   Send initial communications to Partner(s) for approvals (use Deskflow
 macros)
   If there is no answer after two attempts, call the partner using CAM or check if there is an  alternative contact who can approve the transfer
   If there is no progress after using the CAM, file a Wrike with DataOps and immediately flag the RSM to ask if they can review the transfer request and approve it 
   RSM is the correct escalation resource if a Partner gets upset or adds any complexity  to the transfer request
   Once the Wrike has been filed and all possible approvals have been submitted, the Service Desk should advise the "winning" Partner on the process timeline and advise the Partner once everything is complete

Creation date: 2022-10-17 14:13:33 comments: Hi Dexter,
 
 It seems that a customer migration is needed from a current Cloudspace Partner for customer Wildegard Services and all active subscriptions to your Cloudspace account. Our process will record an approval from yourself and the current Partner in our system who owns the account. After both approvals have been received, the request can be sent to our backend team to migrate the customer(s) and all active subscription(s).
 
If you agree to this request, kindly fill out the template below with your information and paste the completed version as a response to this message: 
 
I, [ADD RESPONSIBLE PARTY NAME], representing [ADD PARTNER RECEIVING THE CLIENT], hereby accepts the acquisition of Wildegard Services and with all  active subscriptions on the Cloudspace Platform, effective the following earliest date: [INSERT EFFECTIVE DATE].  
 
If you are denying the request, state the reason for denial. 
 

*Kindly note processing time is subject to Cloudspace obtaining  all required partner and vendor approvals  as well as the services being used by the customer.  Further, given the high volume of requests at or near the end of the month, requests that are received within five days of the last day of the month may not be migrated until the following month.

The old MSP should have removed those licenses. The customer want to directly purchase licensing from Microsoft and already did so.

Subject: Cloudspace - Customer Move

Hi Dexter,

We are working on transferring Wildegard Services to you. The active Microsoft subscriptions that they have will come with the transfer. Do you have an MPNID and CSP with Microsoft now? If yes we have to unlock the Microsoft Partner Shell in the Cloudspace platform so this customer with Microsoft can be transferred to Zimbu. If no we will need to sign you up with MPNID so the process can be finished. Let me know if you have an MPNID and I can hop into a call to help you unlock the partner shell.

Best,
Francisco
