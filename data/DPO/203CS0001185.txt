Thank you for contacting Nimbus Technical Support. I am Sami Huusko and I work as an Infrastructure Support Analyst at Nimbus. So that I may better assist you, could you kindly confirm the resource in question?

What is the ID on the Azure subscription?
A brief summary of the issue
A detailed description of the issue
Steps already taken by your team to troubleshoot the issue
Any errors that occurred and screengrabs of those errors
Additional context that may be useful

I can begin working on this case, but I'd like to first verify whether you would prefer phone or email to be your primary form of contact with Microsoft. If phone, what is the best number to reach you at?
After this info is given to me, I can create this case for you!


Thank you,

Sami

The request includes a description of the resource in question as well as a summary of the issue.

We haven't taken any steps other than what the screengrab details, because we are unsure how to open a request for our client.

Uploaded a screengrab.

The screengrab depicts the problem encountered when attempting to create a support request from within our client's Azure Tenant.

Not sure if this is a problem with Microsoft .

Please make sure you have everything you need by giving us a call.

Great! Thanks you for the information. With our premier agreement with Microsoft support, I am happy to contact Microsoft directly to see if they can fix this issue from their end as soon as possible.

Before starting this case I would like to know if you prefer Microsoft to contact you by phone or email? If you prefer phone, then what's the best phone number for them to call you at?

Once I get all this info, then I will create a case for you!

FYI .. It appears that they have opened a support request. We don't know if that will be the case in the future. This appears to be an extra step that I would like to get rid of.

Could you please respond to the following with the AZ files group policy issue...

Thank you,

Eduardo

Hi Team,
 
Please accept my apologies for not being able to reach you. I am going to continue to archive this service request since no further action is needed from Microsoft at this time. If you have additional questions about this case at a later point in time, please reply to this email. Also if you feel this case has been closed prematurely, please feel free to re-open or create a new ticket at any tie.
 
I was hoping to receive additional information about your problems mounting a Windows file share in Azure and accessing the file share using the storage account key. Sharing a document that may resolve some of your questions:
