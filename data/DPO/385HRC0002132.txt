Happy Afternoon Luther,

Today, the Syed Scott Department of Labor sent this to us through mail. I believe it is a notice for Luther Howard's unemployment benefits. It was Luther's colleague who willingly left his position two weeks ago.


What action must we take in response to this notification? I'm not sure what he feels entitled to because he only worked as an associate for a little over three months and entirely on his own initiative.


Any other information you require, just let me know.

Thanks,
