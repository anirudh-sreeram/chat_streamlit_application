Hello Edicta Team,
Please find the updated open commits report, complete with closing dates and status, attached. 

I wanted to draw your attention to one inconsistency: row 33 in the Carver bancorp loan worksheet the edicta cert # 7588514654 is showed by KFLR111115844, although the cert # of 7312731392 is found in the file. Since cert 7312731391 fits all other information, I think we should activate that coverage for this loan and borrower. Upon searching out system for cer # 75885144654, I am unable to locate the cert linked to any carver bancorp loans.

I underlined the cell added a brief note about the discrepancy in the workbook. If you require any additional information or have any problems activating certificate #7312731392.

Sincerely!
