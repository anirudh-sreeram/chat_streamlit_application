Creation date: 2022-11-26 13:07:08 work_notes: Email Sent From: jude.williams@yahoo.com

Body of Original Email:
Hi Juliet,
I sent my most recent email on the 10th. I waited the 6-8 day period asked by your company to resolve this issue. Despite supplying all gift card numbers and bank account information, I STILL DO NOT HAVE ANY MONEY IN MY ACCOUNT. I am putting out notice that I will direct Keystone lawyers to take up this issue and recover not only the  250 that is owed but also associated fees, if the  250, which I was informed would be sent into my account, is not there by this Sunday, November 27. 
Despite repeated promises that the monies would be transferred, I have received absolutely nothing. This series of emails is evidence beyond any reasonable question that your company has refused to allow usage of these cards in local stores (listed on your affiliated companies).

Keystone Lawyers will receive instructions on Monday at 8 a.m. Any action made after that deadline will be ruled void in any legal proceedings. 
Yours Truly
Jude Williams

Hi Juliet,
This is the identical email that was issued by your organization a week ago when I supplied proof of address. I was already told about the charge waiver (which I appreciate). As a courtesy, I am informing Keystone Lawyers Ltd to postpone any action for 6 days. They have the ten emails I already sent to your company, as well as the responses. If the 250 euros is not deposited into my account by next Tuesday, November 15th at 3 p.m., I will be obliged to continue speaking with local lawyers and take other action in accordance with my consumer rights. This also includes reaching out to firms on social media who handle consumer complaints.
I am going to stop sending emails after this one. I will not respond to any more requests for ID verification or card numbers from your organization - however, any correspondence of this nature will be presented as proof.
After months of correspondence, the green progress report at the bottom of your emails has fluctuated between 1 and 9, but it never reached No. 10 and included a resolution.
Since it has already taken a lot of time, I genuinely hope that this matter is handled by next Tuesday. If you don't pay me, I'll have to spend a lot more time contacting attorneys and social media firms, which will ultimately cost Omnicard Services a lot of money and damage to our name. 
Yours Truly
Jude Williams

Hi Jude,

Thank you for providing the information. I'm checking in regarding your request.

In an act of kindness, I will forgo the  6.50 processing fee per card that is associated with this request to have these cards reimbursed to you.

The volume of cards makes it impossible to process in a single day; therefore, it will take 6 8 working days to process your refund.

Best Wishes,
Juliet H.



Best Wishes,


Omnicard Services Customer Service
