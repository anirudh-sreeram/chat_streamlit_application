A case was opened with a short description of FW: 5 Hours Flex Time
A longer description includes Good Morning,

Please read the information below regarding an employee whose salary is incorrect. They had to manually insert the extra five hours I requested for Tuesday after I wrote a message.
However, her check shows 42 while Rohan says 46. What is the remedy or how can this be fixed. I appreciate it.

Subject: RE: 5 Hours Flex Time

Good Morning Hugo

Quick question, On this week's check, the 5 flex time requested in our earlier email was not given.
Please refer to the screenshot below, which demonstrates that I am only receiving payment for 44.63 hours, not the full 49.63.
My working hours as of right now, according to Oracle time, were 47.63.

Might you have any info on this?

           You requested that the employee be paid on the next pay check, and that is what will happen; they will receive payment for the PTO flex day that was granted late next week. If you wanted it paid as an off-line check, you would have instructed us to do so by completing a payroll adjustment form. The system is set up to pay out on the following pay check since this wasn't done.
