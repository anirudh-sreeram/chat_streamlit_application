Hi Robertson - I am currently resenting an email, so please help as Anita is currently out of the office. Thank you.

PLEASE PROCESS commitment certificate number 6201712570 for the loan closed on 09/25/2022 under the name of JANE. The associated loan number is 0082035617.

The cert should have no monthly borrower payment. Unfortunately, I couldn't activate the cert online. Please inform me if there is anything else you need. Thank you.
