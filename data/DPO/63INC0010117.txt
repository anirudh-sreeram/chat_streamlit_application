I just took up your iPhone problem ticket. I understand that you don't think it got wet but it is possible that the charging port in the phone picked up some moisture by some means. When you travel, where do you put your phone? Condensate is most likely the reason because I've experienced it when biking in previously coz temperature changes from outside to inside. 

It would be best not to override the warning. That could damage the phone further if there is in fact some moisture in it. 

The recommended course of action for resolving these problems is to let the phone dry for one day in a dry location. A bowl of rice isn't really helpful  :) Should that not address the issue, you'll have to make an order for a new phone. 

Tell me how it goes for you.

Cheers 
Kesh

Hello Kesh,

I could examine the charging port and clean it out gently.

They certainly have a tendency to gather fluffy bits. When too much goes in the charging cable could compress it and result in problems with charging.

Now if there is moist fluff that's a completely different problem!

Let me know when you are around then I'll bring something to jab in it and remove fluff from the port.

Cheers
Pete

Amit,

See below re:my phone   Without constantly unplugging and plugging it back in, I can't get the charge to get over 39%.

I've updated the software, tried several cords, etc., and it's not moist from cycling (kept safe  in my backpack).

I'll give it my best go, but I may need to request another one

Pete
