Your ticket for the screen turning white and then blank has been assigned to me. On Monday, will you be near the HQ NC? Just to be sure, is this on your laptop's screen or an external monitor?

Thanks,

Good morning, I'm at the office, however, I'm not sure whether it would be worthwhile for you to fix my laptop because the refresh group has added a replacement ticket for it and will be sending me a new one at some point given the problems I've been having with it.  I'll be in the office all day if you want to come down.
