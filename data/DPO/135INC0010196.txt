Hey Priyanka,

On the same PO, FSMG902544321 we receive an additional charge of $3455.65. They employed the incorrect UOM. In what way was this resolved?

We will need to void DME305-159.

Let me know.

Thanks,

Good afternoon,

Could you please assist me with the email or backup paperwork regarding the deduction of $512.52 Taken PO E305-4322

I don't know of any problems. If I should not have included you in this email, I sincerely apologize.

I am uncertain about the AP contact's identity, and Edison is not in today.
