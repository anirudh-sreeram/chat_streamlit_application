Parent Incident work note copied: Hi Mayank!
 
Since I've been working from home and left my adaptor at the office, I haven't been able to get the logs yet. I'll send these logs along tomorrow while I'm in the office.  Apologies for the delay!
 
Thanks!

Hello Myconda,
 
I appreciate you testing this latest version. Would you kindly gather the following logs using the most recent release?
 
1.      Client logs for  CWA Chrome
2.      Logs for CWA Chrome console
3.      Logs for MS Teams Optimization
4.      Screen recording illustrating the problem
 
Listed below is the procedure to collect the logs:
 
https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/chrome-citrix-workspace-app/repair.htm
 
If you have any questions, kindly inform me. 
 
Thanks,
--Mayank

I tried my best, but I was unable to finish every step:
 
1) I succeeded in obtaining client logs. I have attached them (to the email)

2) I could not get the console logs. No options were listed in apps. However, I saw this in the instructions you had given:
"The console logs are now included in the client logs as of version 1106 and later. Thus, gathering the client logs on their own is enough."
Citrix Workspace on this Chromebook is version 11.6.1.17.  Is it still required that I get the console logs?
 
3) The Teams optimization logs were not available to me. I opened on-screen keyboard and pressed  CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + 1, yet nothing opened in the VDI or on the Chromebook under the downloads folder. This, I suppose, is the result of my problem, which prevents the call from connecting. Steps one and two instruct to open the Microsoft Teams application, start a call with a user, and then maximize the Teams window once the call is connected. However, as you can see in the screen recording, the call is never connected.

4) The problem has been captured in the screen recording attached (to the email)
 
Kindly inform me if there is anything I can do to modify or give any more details.  Thanks!

Hello Myconda,
I appreciate the explanation and am sorry for any confusion. It appears that those logs were not generated, but I am not sure why. I'll investigate that as I examine the previously given logs.
Thanks,

Hello again,
I have no problem sending the logs to you. In fact, I would be glad to do that if it was possible. The issue is that I am not even unable to get the console logs.
After I did as directed by these instructions:
https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/chrome-citrix-workspace-app/repair.htm
Step 1 for console logs instructs "open chrome://inspect/#apps". I could do this.
Step 2 instructs "Click on  inspect  in the Application tab for all Citrix Workspace-related windows: SessionWindow.html, Main.html"
Yet, as I mentioned in my earlier email, I can't see anything on that page. I can't even click on  inspect ; the page is absolutely blank. If I can't complete this stage, how can I obtain logs? I attempted this in Chrome on the VDI, as well as in Chrome in Storefront, and they both display the same thing.

How do I upload console logs? When I go to apps on that page, there are no options listed.

Hello Myconda,
I appreciate you uploading the logs. I'll work to get our engineering team to investigate the problem at the code level. The Console logs will probably be requested by them, so please upload those as soon as you can.
Thanks,

We appreciate that you reached out and shared those observations. Throughout this week, Mayank is on leave, thus I am investigating this case in his absence. 

By assessing the internal correspondence related to this case, I can observe that our internal teams is diligently working on this case. We requested that the latest version of CWA be installed because it contains some fixes which are alike as well as needed 1) to see if those solutions would take care of your problem and 2) if not, collect fresh logs with this updated version in order to continue searching for a solution.

We'll need to collect fresh batch of logs before moving further for a solution. This does not imply that you will need to hold off until the next version is made available. By examining the logs, we might be able to identify a fix without needing to update CWA. Having said that, obtaining a new CWA version with a fix would be necessary if we discover that it is a bug.

I appreciate your patience as we work toward a solution and I am extremely sorry for the delay in finding a solution. For now, in order to help our internal teams continue their efforts for a solution, I would appreciate it if you could gather a fresh set of logs and upload them.

Kind Regards,
Manchu Lakshmi

Good afternoon!
Even after updating the Citrix Workspace app to version 20.10.0.30, I am still not able to connect to a Teams meeting and I continue to receive the same error message: It seems that connection to the camera component is working because I can see myself in the cam preview, but when I try to participate in a meeting, I get the "Sorry, we couldn't connect you." screen again.
Is there anything more that can be done from our side, apart from gathering logs and wait for another version of Citrix Workspace? I tried this in Citrix Workspace in three versions, and each time I encountered the same problem.

Hi!
I'm working on this at the office today, but I'm having trouble getting the app to update. As it's a managed Chromebook, I'm not able to update it myself. I believe I have to wait for the administrator to push the update. I will get in touch with the administrator to ask him to push it to the device, but he is on leave right now.  Once it has been updated and I have made an effort to replicate the error, I will email you back.
Thanks!
