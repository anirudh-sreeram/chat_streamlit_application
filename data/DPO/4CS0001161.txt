We have your request to move your Techsquad account under Nimbus. Techsquad needs an approval notice from the distributor you are using now (Techsquad Immediate, Microlead, Micro Tek, Tempest, etc.) to transfer the account. Please utilize the following template to request this approval from your distributor via email. This will notify Techsquad that you would like to transfer your account and also initiate the move request with them. Please reach out if you have other questions.
