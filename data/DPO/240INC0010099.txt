Aditya,

The username for the email address WANEVARMA1995@GMAIL.COM,  is already in use. Kindly inform the client that they must select a new email address as their login username.

Her husband's login in WERT appears to be WANEVARMA1995@GMAIL.COM, and based on the screenshot, we are generating her profile via email, WVARMA44@GMAIL.COM  when she creates it.

Thank you,
Param Parekh

Yes, the problem is that the customer's email address that her spouse has registered with automatically appears when she enters her name, social media account, and birthdate to create her account. Thank you for checking in, but we are still looking for a solution.
