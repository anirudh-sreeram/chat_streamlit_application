Subject: P2: incident INC0919327 - Can't print tag label list on clearance as facing an issue
Importance: High

Hello SQL DBAs,

We have a ticket on high priority P3 ticket # INC0989736 for eSOMS. The Uzair Golden Unit 2 Plant is in an outage and they are facing  a timeout error. We faced similar error previously and we have reindexed the database. This will have to happen again. Please reindex the eSOMS database on jvmwnt1075 at the earliest  so the plant can continue with their outage. 

Please work on this with high priority. Let us know if you face any issues.  

Note: Before reindexed the database please do a backup on the database, so that we can send it to eSOMS vendor to replicate this error from their end. 

I have generated a zendesk ticket #INC0998411 for your reference.

Hi Aneesa, 

It worked and the error has been solved! Thanks for your quick action on this error!!

 I am thinking whether that reindex job is set to run daily at eSOMS  database server jvmwnt1075, Could you please confirm if it is working properly? Is there any way (logs) to find it out? I am asking this because this error happened twice within a week. Please do check this and let us know.

 Warm Regards,
