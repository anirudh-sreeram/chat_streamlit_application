Hello Team,
Can you help?
Below troubleshooting actions were carried out:
- [L1 Consulted]
- [According to L1: There is a "Revoke Authenticator sessions" button,  however, not sure if Service Desk has permission to utilize it or if this is a temporary measure]
- [Kindly confirm if this action to disable AFM is allowed]
Thanks in advance.
Creation date: 2023-02-27 16:55:31 work_notes: Hello Team, in order to prohibit interactive logon if truly wish to disable the AFM, check with the user and add this service account to the 'SIG-LocalInterfacesDenyLogon" group. After disabling interactive logon, you could add this service account to 'Microsoft AFM Exception' so that it is not included in AFM. Note, we must obtain permission from the  RMQ team in order to get  interactive logon access (RDP) and disable AFM.
