Molly,
  I was aware that this would occur. 
The 5 units that you sent back were never billed to Manhudon. No credit owed was provided by the RGA.
  However, on check# 1400521012 they debited DF Uityu $2152.00 for the 5 units.

  Please have your accounting department pay us back in full.

Many Thanks,
Rima Gill

Anil,

Good noon,

Do you still have those 4 extra G7890SP-PAN's lying around? That can be returned to us, as I mentioned in my earlier email. If it's more convenient for you, I'd like to send my warehouse over there and pick them up. These were the pans you were not billed for,Rick shipped too many.

I don't know what the RGA/debit was for, but if we weren't billed then I am fine with it. I would rather wait until we are done shipping this job to send anything back so we can make sure we don't need an extra if something is broken. Can we take care of this now, or does it need to wait a few more weeks? Many thanks

That works for me if it works for Molly; I don't really deal with the money side of anything (I only get RGAs), so I'd say its her call if this is acceptable.

Danny,

We went through your PO and what was billed (not sent out) byRick and it matches up. Those 2 tubs, the G2306's, you were not billed for them. They were replacements issued at no charge.

What I would do, is just toss them or give them to someone but we aren't going to get Rick involved, they'll hit you with a restock fee.

For the 4 SB6306's, you can send those back to Qrtyu at no charge. I am not sure how we ended up with 4 more, you were billed for 145 but received 149.

Is that effective for all users? If returning the pans to Qrtyu is really difficult, we can take them. Just let me know.

Thanks,

  We can't issue you an RGA at this time because you received some extra units that have not been paid for by Manhudon.
  Since Molly is aware of this issue, I have copied her on his email. Rick and I are talking to clear things up.
  I'll stay in touch.
