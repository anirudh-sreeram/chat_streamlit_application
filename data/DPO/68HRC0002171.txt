I hope everything is fine with you!

Since Kendra only included the last page of the agreement, we need her to email it again.

Can we let Kendra know that wee need those 7 pages scanned, in order to complete the payment process. Shall we inform Kendra to be aware of this? Many thanks


Warm Regards,
Carla Luna
