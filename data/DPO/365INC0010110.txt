Hello Myconda,
I appreciate the explanation and am sorry for any confusion. It appears that those logs were not generated, but I am not sure why. I'll investigate that as I examine the previously given logs.

Hi again,
I have no problem sending the logs to you. In fact, I would be glad to do that if it was possible. The issue is that I am not even unable to get the console logs.
After I did as directed by these instructions:
https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/chrome-citrix-workspace-app/repair.htm
Step 1 for console logs instructs "open chrome://inspect/#apps". I could do this.
Step 2 instructs "Click on  inspect  in the Application tab for all Citrix Workspace-related windows: SessionWindow.html, Main.html"
Yet, as I mentioned in my earlier email, I can't see anything on that page. I can't even click on  inspect ; the page is absolutely blank. If I can't complete this stage, how can I obtain logs? I attempted this in Chrome on the VDI, as well as in Chrome in Storefront, and they both display the same thing.

How do I upload console logs? When I go to apps on that page, there are no options listed.

Hello Myconda,
I appreciate you uploading the logs. I'll work to get our engineering team to investigate the problem at the code level. The Console logs will probably be requested by them, so please upload those as soon as you can.
Thanks,

We appreciate that you reached out and shared those observations. Throughout this week, Mayank is on leave, thus I am investigating this case in his absence.

By assessing the internal correspondence related to this case, I can observe that our internal teams is diligently working on this case. We requested that the latest version of CWA be installed because it contains some fixes which are alike as well as needed 1) to see if those solutions would take care of your problem and 2) if not, collect fresh logs with this updated version in order to continue searching for a solution.

We'll need to collect fresh batch of logs before moving further for a solution. This does not imply that you will need to hold off until the next version is made available. By examining the logs, we might be able to identify a fix without needing to update CWA. Having said that, obtaining a new CWA version with a fix would be necessary if we discover that it is a bug.

I appreciate your patience as we work toward a solution and I am extremely sorry for the delay in finding a solution. For now, in order to help our internal teams continue their efforts for a solution, I would appreciate it if you could gather a fresh set of logs and upload them.

Best Regards,
Manchu Lakshmi

Good afternoon!
Even after updating the Citrix Workspace app to version 20.10.0.30, I am still not able to connect to a Teams meeting and I continue to receive the same error message: It seems that connection to the camera component is working because I can see myself in the cam preview, but when I try to participate in a meeting, I get the "Sorry, we couldn't connect you." screen again.
Is there anything more that can be done from our side, apart from gathering logs and wait for another version of Citrix Workspace? I tried this in Citrix Workspace in three versions, and each time I encountered the same problem.

Hi!
I'm working on this at the office today, but I'm having trouble getting the app to update. As it's a managed Chromebook, I'm not able to update it myself. I believe I have to wait for the administrator to push the update. I will get in touch with the administrator to ask him to push it to the device, though she is on leave right now.  Once it has been updated and I have made an effort to replicate the error, I will email you back.
Thanks!
Myconda Zenkon
