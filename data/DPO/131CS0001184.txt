Hi Ben ,
 
I trust you are doing well.

We have not received your response to our inquiry. Could you please share the start and end times of the outage, along with the names of the session host VMS that encountered the DNS issue? This information is crucial for us to proceed with our root cause analysis.

Hi Ben,
 
Thank you for our discussion earlier today. You can contact me either by replying to this e-mail or calling the phone number provided in my signature below.

As we agreed, I have adjusted the severity of this case downward since the issue was resolved shortly after our call, and all session hosts are now operational. You mentioned that during the outage the non-function VMs encountered time out errors while attempting to resolve host names, including google.com. Your VNet is configured to utilize the AADDS domain controllers for name resolution. We will investigate further to determine the root cause of the name resolution failures.

Feel free to let me know if you have any questions or concerns

 
Warm regards,

I trust all is well with you. I wanted to reach out and inquire if there are any updates on your end.
Creation date: 2022-10-20 15:16:06 work_notes: Hello Karen,



1. We are currently looking into the incident involving AVD instances encountering time out errors while attempting to resolve DNS names. This issue is preventing them from resolving the necessary AVD URLs, Leading to service outage.

2. The verification indicates that the VNet indeed relies on your AADDS domain controllers for DNS resolution. It is assumed that the AADDS domain controllers forward DNS request to 168.63.128.15 For the zones they cannot resolve. After examining the forwarder logs, it has been confirmed that there are no responsive DNS queries observed on the azure forwarder.

3. I am collaborating with the AADDS team to explore the possibility of obtaining DNS logs from the domain controllers. These logs could provide insights into whether the VM request reached the DC's. Additionally, I recommend checking the event logs for your VMs for similar information.

Feel free to reach out if you have any additional questions or concerns.

Regards, 

Abrar Khan
