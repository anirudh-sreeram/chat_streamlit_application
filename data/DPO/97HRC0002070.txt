Dear Waste Connections Team:

I work for Etsy Solutions' Qualified Order team (QMCSO service) and need payroll verified within two working days.

The National Medical Support Notice states that coverage can only be added to an employee's account if the premiums are within a particular withholding limit. Please supply both the employees' aggregate disposable weekly earnings (ADWE)*, Net Paycheck and Gross Paycheck amounts, and any cash child support garnishments to demonstrate we comply with the conditions of the order.

*ADWE is the net income remaining after statutory deductions such as state, federal, and local taxes, as well as Social Security and Medicare taxes.  

Please see the attached spreadsheet. The password will be supplied in the email that follows.

Thanks,

The Waste Connections QMCSO Team
