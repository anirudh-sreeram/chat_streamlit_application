Could you kindly examine this branch to check if there is anything happening from a network end? Since last 2 days they have been having problems with disconnected calls and one way audio on both incoming and outgoing.

Additionally, they maintain that every applications like CLASS, MsgApp, email etc are freezing and performing very sluggishly. I have asked call instances and time stamps to send.

** EMAIL NOT INTERNAL  BE CAREFUL **

Trent,

Transport seems fine. A few dlay spike are there on the Back UP  however that wil not lead to any problem with drop call.

I observe that calls have increased jitter spike which can lead to problems with QOS

Trent,

Today, the TeleMont engineering group did certain thorough investigation on this site and has made certain alterations to the primary internet circuit in order to assist with the network problems that the branch has been noting.  It will take a bit for those alterations to correctly show results.  If you could kindly send me the ticket you have for this, I will monitor until Tuesday evening and inspect the network performance at that time.

I have also contacted the branch and talked to Amelia.  I informed her that I will contact on Tuesday to see if they note the overall network experience becoming better also.

Contact me in case you have any queries.

Thank you,
