A case was opened with a short description of FW: restore the policy 5477146859
A longer description includes PRIVATE

Happy Afternoon,

When I phoned about this certificate previously, I was informed that the reinstallation request had been turned down since the payment for July was thirty days overdue. Alfred from United Faith Funding informed me that the loan's June and July installments were received before the servicing was transferred. In order to demonstrate that the browser was not late, the lender is asking if we may include the payment history that is connected to the original reinstatement request. If so, they will grant resumption.

Please notify me. Thanks,
