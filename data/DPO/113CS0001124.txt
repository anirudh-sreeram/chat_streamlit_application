Hi Gabriela:  It seems as if they closed the loan on 4/24/22 and the initial amount was paid on 5/31/22.  We think it was a mailing problem. They usually pay on the 14th. The PMI amount wasn't paid by Wesser because our PMI payee code wasn't filling in when the loan was entered into MSP for Servicing.  Your thoughts are valued.  
Thank you!

Gabriela,

I have a query on the pay history that is enclosed.  We are attempting to reinstate this one and this one has one delinquency beyond the 30 days.    This does NOT have any that are 60 days or more. Will it be reinstated by Shield?  I don't have a lot of time to get this some of these certificates reinstated because Clinton MC wants report regarding these loans and their mortgage insurance status.  All the remaining certificates have proper pay histories.

I'll send over shortly the certification along with the list of loans that are going to be reinstated. Can they be reinstated immediately or will payment need to be sent before they can be reinstated? We will ask for premiums today and overnight on Friday as well. If it's more convenient, I can order an ACH today. Kindly let me know and thank you.

Hi Anaya,

These certificates are also cancelled since the premium wasn't paid. if you like, you can look at their pay histories and certify their payment status using the previous certificates we sent earlier. They can be added to the certification that was sent to you. Please make sure to include a sheet with all the certificate numbers that you are certifying so they can be placed in our records. We also need the premium payment for these certificates.

Hello Gabriela:

I just left a voicemail related to the certificates here.  Can you confirm the status of these certificates regarding whether they are active or cancelled? Regards,

Gabriela:

When we go into the Shield site, these certificates do not display us as the servicer.  Can you assist with confirming that these haven't been cancelled and we will send any premiums that are due overnight? Regards,
