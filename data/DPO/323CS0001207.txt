Hi Alex x2 and Kendra!

Hoping you all have had a amazing week and are having a nice Thursday.

I located the deprovision task on our side (https://app.nimbus.com/provisioning-tasks/4967517), which ran and is now complete. Should I do a hard delete on my end to finish this? Kindly let me know if there are any other measures to be taken  from the Nimbus end to get this finalized.

Hi Alexander,
 
The partner verifies they would like to cancel the account with Innovatec. In March  22, he told me the downgrade to PAYG was handled by Nimbus side. 
 
Kindly find attached a written verification to close the account. Once Nimbus remove the account in their market, I will send in a request for termination   can you keep me updated once it is done? 
 
Warm regards,

Hi Alexander,
 
Grateful for the follow up. 
 
I just looked at the history and it seems we did not get any requests to downgrade the account. 
 
I ve worked to migrate his client to be straight with Innovatec and the tenant is now deactivated. I m not sure if the partner will continue or cease to use the platform. I ve tried to contact him but he s not responding now.  
 
I will ask again to better understand their reasons: if they will quit using the service, I will request written verification in order to begin the procedure internally as well as with Nimbus. In the event they want to continue to use the platform and be on PAYG channel, I will also ask for written verification to properly downgrade the account using CBF in SFDC.
 
I will keep you updated in both situations, so we can move forward in the way that makes the most sense.
 
Warm regards,

Kendra/Roisin,

Can you look into this account (Lynxcorp IT).  Until March, we were charging them on a tier 2 commit in accordance with the numbers in PBI, when we started charging in accordance with usage  
 
 
Issue is, nothing has changed in SFDC or the console. If this ended up with PayGo, a CBF should have been done to reflect the change in SF & in the console, provision should have switched them over to PayGo. Did you get a downgrade email for them back in February/March-ish from Nimbus?
 
The only client under their tenant is deactivated now and just a bit over a gig of data and no workloads . PBI is also showing them as churn. We have to have Nimbus cancel in their market if they have quit using the platform. That way we have a confirmation email to officially terminate them on the inside. If that is how it is, let me know and I will speak with Nimbus to get this done. We have to be careful to follow this process so there is an audit trail.

Grateful for your help.
 
Regards,
Alexander

Hi all,
 
Below are the stats 
 
  The Commons Program Institute has been migrated and is not  under Nimbus in US5
  Lynxcorp IT is under the Nimbus MP USD (Reseller 1070356) account in US5 and is on a tier 2 commit with Innovatec in SF.  But they have 1 client who is deactivated and only 1.97GB of storage and no workloads.  Has the service been cancelled for them in the Nimbus market?

Thank you,
Alexander

Hi Team,
 
Just looking to follow up and verify this account move was finalized? Looks like this ticket fell through the cracks as there haven't been any updates from the Partner/Vendor. Just wanted to verify before I close out the ticket

Dear all,
 
The partner verifies the client account (The Common Program) doesn t have any commitment with them. 
 
We can generate a new account in US5 datacenter and port the data. 
 
I'll collaborate with cloud provisioning and keep you in the loop regarding next steps or if additional info is required.

Dear all, 
 
Sorry for the delay in replying. 
 
Gabriela is not with Innovatec anymore. So technically this can be done. It would be a change process through standard channels.
 
We need to verify with Lynxcorp IT that their client has no commitments and no outstanding balances. We also need to verify that we can port the data away.
 
I will request one of PSMs reach out to the partner. 
 
@Kendra, please can you reach out to the partner.

Thanks

Hi Sid,
 
I am going to add @Gabriela Dia Little to work on this one since she is in charge of the Lynxcorp IT account. Why do they want to move away from their partner, do you know?
 
Gabriela   Is this something we would usually give approval for?

Hello April  and Team,
 
Partner Lynxcorp IT submitted a request for a client account, The Commons Program, to part ways with Lynxcorp IT and go straight to Innovatec.
 
Can this be done? also can this be fulfilled on US5?

Kindly let me know what info is needed to accommodate this request.
 
Thanks!
