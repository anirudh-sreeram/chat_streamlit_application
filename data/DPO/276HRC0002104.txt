We are genuinely grateful for your understanding. The ongoing effects of the COVID situation are still causing delays in our industry. Factors such as challenges in sourcing raw materials, freight delays, port congestion, and reduced factory capacities are contributing to these prolonged lead times

As a result of these factors outside our influence, we anticipate the estimated time of arrival (ETA) will be postponed to a next date, and we are unable to provide a specific ETA.
