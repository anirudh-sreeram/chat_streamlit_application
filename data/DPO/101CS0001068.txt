Hello Mr Hanna

Unluckily, to meet the requirements of the solo campaigns and rewards, the gift tokens are bought to Postal Service. 

The token expired, but it was just last month, so I am not sure whether there is any grace period for that token. Initially as a first step, to find this out you may want to use the below link and try to verify the balance online: 
Balance Verify (magiccard.com)
|Balance Verify   MagicCard To use your gift token, please verify your balance and expiry date first. For that, follow these steps: Step 1: Find the 14-digit Card number and 4-digit CVV3 number either on the front or back of your gift token.
Step 2: Enter the numbers in the required fields. 
Step 3: Click the Verify Balance button to verify your remaining balance and expiry date of the token.
Please note that the purchase date of this token and use your token in ...www.magiccard.com |

Checking on their website, I would like to suggest you to contact the MagicCard customer support line, the screen grab attached below are the details I have found for this purpose.
