End-consumer Canair Mechanical is trying to switch from reseller Citadel IT Nerds.
Creation date: 2022-09-27 16:52:57 comments: Good morning Raphael,

As long as the subscriptions are active, our team can move a client's company profile subscriptions and billing between Cloudspace partners. To do this, we need to record your approval and the current partner's approval in our system. Once both approvals are received, we can submit a request to our backend team to move the client(s) and any active subscriptions over. However, the client's current partner has submitted a cancellation request for September 29, which is currently preventing us from moving this client over. I've reached out to them, offering guidance on how to bring their subscriptions back online. I'll keep you informed as soon as I hear back.

If you agree to this request, kindly fill out the template below with your details and send it back with the filled out version:

As a representative of [INSERT PARTNER RECEIVING THE CLIENT], I, [INSERT RESPONSIBLE PARTY NAME], hereby accept the acquisition of [Canair Mechanical] and all ongoing subscriptions on the Cloudspace Platform, with the earliest effective date being [INSERT EFFECTIVE DATE].

Would you kindly let us know why the request is being denied, if it is?

*Please know that processing time is dependent on the services being used by the client and is subject to the timely reception of all necessary partner and vendor approvals by Cloudspace. Due to a high volume of requests that are submitted near or at the end of the month, requests that are received within five days of the end of the month may not be transferred until the next month.

Checklist:

  If it doesn't already exist, create Deskflow tickets for "winning" Partner's acquisition approval
   If it doesn't already exist, create a Deskflow ticket for "losing" Partner's release approval
  In Deskflow, put the ticket number from the "losing" partner in the Parent field of the "winning" Partner's ticket to link the two tickets together
  To authorize an acquisition or release, choose the Main Partner Administrator
   Add CAM to DeskFlow Watchlist for losing Partner
   Look for running services on the CloudSpace platform
   Determine whether the "winning" Partner has the proper Partner Shells setup based on the running services
   To find out if a client has any services that would be provided under the Partners shadow business, search for the client's name in One Time Charges
   Ask the "losing" Partner, if they have no running services, whether they can just remove the customer from their Platform account instead of approving a transfer
   Send first communications to Partner(s) for approval (using Deskflow macros).
   If there is no answer after two tries, engage CAM to either contact the Partner by phone or  see if there is alternative contact who can authorize the transfer
   After involving the CAM, if no progress is achieved, submit a Wrike to DataOPS and tag the RSM right away so they may examine the transfer request and choose whether to authorize it
   The appropriate resource for escalation is the RSM in the event a Partner is dissatisfied or adding complexities to the transfer request
   Deskflow should keep the "winning" Partner informed on the timeline of the process, after the Wrike is filed and all approvals that were obtained have been submitted

Upon reviewing this request, I discovered that the client's prior MSP had terminated their licensing, and you had renewed the client's subscription under your account. As a result, we will close this ticket. If you still need help with this, please deny the Closure of this case and let us know how we can help.

Please phone 855-883-CSPC if you would like to speak with someone and get help. Alternatively, you can manage and reply to all tickets using the app.cloudspace.com.
