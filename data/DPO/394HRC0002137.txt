Good day,



We are appealing repeated hiring qualification for GoodStart Driver Nate Mays EID#791300293.



Nate resigned from his role in June of this year and was deemed unqualified for reemployment due to an improper social media post. Nate posted the message, "Happy HIV AIDS Awareness Month" under Waste Connections's PRIDE celebration.  Nate has subsequently expressed his regret to leadership, as shown in the attached apology, and is interested in rejoining Waste Connections.


Although we acknowledge that Nate's behavior was improper, we also trust that he genuinely regrets his actions and has gained insight from his lapse in judgment.  Nate's commitment to the company for over 20 years is a significant factor in considering a second opportunity..



Appreciate you for your attention.

Troy,



Good Day! Our driver who made an improper Instagram post seeks to return. Enclosed is an apology letter. I support allowing his return, despite the comment and his abrupt departure during the investigation. He left for what he thought was a "better job" but soon realized the value of his previous position here. I'm aware that he's heard about the positive changes happening here. Concerning the remarks, I believe he acknowledges his mistake and understands it We should uphold the principles of treating everyone with decency and esteem, anyhow of personal views. He was an excellent driver with a clean record before the comment incident.



I have faith in people's ability to make mistakes, learn from them, and come back stronger. Given his improved health, I also endorse reevaluating his eligibility for rehire.



I appreciate your time and understanding If the decision is to uphold the "not eligible for rehire" status,. Appreciate you!
