Hello Carrie,

I hope all is okay with you.
Could you kindly assist Aryan with his request for a VIP Bonus?
If the distribution date occurs after his last day of employment with the company, he would like assurance that his VIP Bonus will be paid out.

If you grant his request, he can use this during offboarding as proof that payroll must still pay out the VIP Bonus. Employees who leave the company are not eligible for a VIP Bonus, according to our stated policy.

I appreciate your assistance in advance.

Warm regards,
Earl
