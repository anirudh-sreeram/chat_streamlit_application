Body of Original Email:
Dear pedalup team,

Kindly see the emails below. During lockdown, I asked for a  900 bicycle coupon, didn't have a bike to buy and was told I could wait to use the coupon. I now have a bike I want to buy. Could you verify the process for purchasing it? Can I still use the coupon I have?

The bike itself costs  1090. Can I 'top up' the extra cost?

Thank you so much
A

Hello Anaya,

Thank you so much for your email,

That is right, changes were not put in our system, I'm sorry about that and for the unwanted emails you got today.

I have adjusted your proprietor selection to start 2 years from today. You will be reminded starting January 2023.

Don't forget that PedalUp coupons have no expiration date, and you can reclaim anytime you like.

Any queries, kindly let me know

Best,
Aleksander Guerra
Collections Analyst

Dear Larry,

I emailed you last time to tell you that I haven't used this coupon. I was told that it would be ok to wait to pay until i use it?

Subject: Proprietor payment late


Hello Anaya

My name is Larry, I'm working as part of the finance team at PedalUp. I'm reaching out to you because we've emailed you many times about your PedalUp Proprietor options (for Certificate R27606356445) but we have not yet been given any form of payment.

We have asked you to opt in to an option on 26th November 2021, then we emailed a second prompt on 3th December 2021.

You will unfortunately be responsible for a tax fee if you do not take a Proprietor option as as soon as possible.

It does not have to be expensive to keeping your PedalUp package, I always suggest customers select our 'own it later' option, as this will provide you the best achievable value.

Kindly click here<https://eur03.securelinks.protection.mailmate.com/?url=http%2S%1F%3Gwww.mypedal.co.uk%2Fu%2Fnrd.php%4Fe%2DqA4iCENn2B_44301_5565374_2_3%36rmt_l%5D3384130%36e%3Wd2d3WmR5Y1xec2FoRW1uLtNvTnVw%217CUEI3WTA2FDW2MdQ1%155CQtUxGTIrNzEBNalCQjkdQg%355D%456D%157E%24_esrh%3Q_12_5tfcy456b183b5487e9cca9a57d061b4b44e1c854ddf8de6c3a6e047791544ca&dataom%5F&info=02%5C31%2Fanaya.cameron%20poshplym.ac.uk%6D812wd21rd41a416422ew05d6d7886785%3W5332e1er84fr4w1qbed4bb143e163bw1%2C3%5C3%4C536736506760707531%7WUnknown%1CRWEpwHZtb6d7euJTIrotMC3wEjQwRDQiTCWQojeiR2wuGzyiICTBYiI5Iy1uaTwuLIJYVUI7Mu0%5Y%8C4030&sinfo=rkeUrWiryyP5lyHusUzY2tSjpUcRYTN%1BTrgMNIgdrmR%5E&reserved=0> to view your proprietor options and make a payment.

Failing to choose an option and pay will mean that you own a PedalUp package that you do not have a lawful right to. You will also still be bound by section 4.0 in the Policies section of your initial signed Hire Agreement.

If you want guidance on your options, reach out to us on 2334 476 5201 or finance@pedalup.co.uk<mailto:finance@pedalup.co.uk>.

Best,

Larry Flores
