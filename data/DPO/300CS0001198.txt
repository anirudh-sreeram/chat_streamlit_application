A case was opened with a short description of RE: AVD Problem [NIM3250955]
A longer description includes Hello there,

I am reopening this case as the user has recently informed us that the issue persists. Despite being on the latest FSLogix instance, they continue to encounter the pop up. It's worth nothing that while it doesn't occur every time, it is still happening multiple times a day.

I have just dispatched the meeting invitation. I look forward to our discussion on Monday.

Regards,
David

Creation date: 2022-09-26 21:30:20 comments: Hello Victory, 

Thank you for taking the time to call. After looking at the environment and noting that this is only occurring from this specific pool and the metrics don't obviously state a reason for this we have decided to escalate to Microsoft. This case will be transferred to our Vendor Assistance team. Once a Microsoft Engineer has been assigned to your case, someone from our Vendor Assistance team will contact you to facilitate communications with Microsoft.

Regards,
David

Thank you for getting in touch. Initially, the Microsoft engineer overlooked including me in their initial e-mail. I have sense been added, and I have now included you in that e-mail thread as well.

Thanks!
Creation date: 2022-10-07 14:38:09 work_notes: Hi Jose,

I trust you are having a wonderful day.

I know that this case requires the Office team to be involved, but this co-op has been opened for a week with no signs of progress.

Microsoft typically closes cases out on us if there is no forward progress within three days. How is it acceptable to deviate from your own policy?

We urgently need to move forward on this case today, please.

Thanks,

Any updates on this? Is there a specific reason for the prolonged delay in assigning an engineer?

Hi Victory,
 Regrettably, I am still awaiting the assignment of an engineer to the collaboration task I initiated with the Office team.
I will continue to provide updates.
We appreciate your patience.

Hi Victory,
We appreciate the time you spent today. The discussed issue is unrelated to the FSlogix, as we were able to replicate it with an account not managed by FSlogix.
The problem specifically occurs when users attempt to save a file in their redirected profile folder.
It does not manifest when saving files locally.

As the next step, I have submitted a request for an engineer from the Office team. Once the engineer is assigned, we will contact you to proceed with further investigation. 

We appreciate it.

Warm regards,

Jose Atkinson
