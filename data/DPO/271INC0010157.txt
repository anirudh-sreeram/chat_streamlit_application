==========================

EFFECT ON USER BUSINESS
------------------------------------
Out of 3 node clusters 1 got failed, business continuity affected on production environment.

PRESENT STATUS
------------------------------------
On today s zoom session with customer:
As outlined on KB 15362, ENG-62919 were updated in order to update dflag values.

EARLIER ACTIONS
------------------------------------
++ use the MCC health_checks system_checks enough_disk_space_check 
++ search on curator.INFO logs fro /kCanceled tasks look for the reviewer 
++ kCanceled scan status.

ACTION PLAN
------------------------------------
++ Customer verified all the tasks successfully with the following command on any DVM that belongs to the affected cluster:

curator_cli get_last_successful_scans


++ Curator task takes several hours to complete, customer will monitor for 10hrs, if see that the alert stills appears or something the curator scans did not finish should call VxRail.

++ TSF gave links command to navigate and see Executor scans and warn customer to not modify/update or start any task from it.
