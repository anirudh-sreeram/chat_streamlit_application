Dear Isra,
Despite being a vendor, Corovan Movers should not have any badges or access to Trellix systems. What should I do to take them off the list so he would not get any more emails?

Dear Aryan,
Please, could you assist me with this?
Our staff is not hard badged, I replied.
Who is this for, and who do I need to get the document signed by?
We have over200 crew members who could be transported to Trellix, therefore I cannot ask everyone to sign a form

Please let us know if this applies to us?

Thank you
Douglas Davies
