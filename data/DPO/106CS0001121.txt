A case was opened with a short description of RE: Bank of Bowen - Cert 3472989103
A longer description includes CONFIDENTIAL

Lender Services,

Bank of Bowen received a validation notification from their MILAR file, which indicated that Cert 3472989103 is showing as a canceled certificate in our system. In response, they clarified that the certificate should actually be active since it had been approved for reinstatement (see below).

Kindly guide Shawna Nichol (cc'd) and let them know if any further action is required or if this is simply a matter of timing.

Thank you!

Hi,

Please review the attached exceptions generated using the 10 2022 MILAR Report you sent. Please note that there are three tabs that need to be reviewed. If a tab is blank, it means that, for that month, there are no loans for that specific exception/validation.

-1st tab: Inactive - This specific tab shows loans that our system identifies as inactive, but the removal code does not indicate that these loans will be removed from the report. According to our system, the date when the certificate became inactive is more than 4 months ago. We kindly request that you remove the Assure code from your system so that these loans will be removed from the report. ****If you have any inquiries regarding the loan on the tab, please contact our Lenders Service Department. ZIPH.MortgageLenderServices@assurance.com<mailto:ZIPH.MortgageLenderServices@assurance.com> or 800-400-6647 to confirm the correct status of this loan.****

-2nd tab: No Match - The loans listed in this tab do not have any active certificate numbers associated with them, as identified by our system. Please provide the loans included in the list so that we may check if there is an active certificate number for them. If an active certificate number cannot be found, please remove these loans from your MILAR file. ****It is important to note that if there are loans on this report that were included in your original submission and the numbers match, it is likely due to inconsistent formatting of the certificate number. All certificate and loan numbers must be formatted consistently either as all text or all numeric.****

-3rd tab: MILAR Validation - This tab contains a list of loans that exhibit inconsistencies between the report data and our system. A detailed description of the error can be found within this sheet.

You do not need to resubmit your file; however, we kindly request that you review the MILAR validation report and provide an explanation for the discrepancies. We would appreciate it if you could mark the differences directly on the spreadsheet or provide a written explanation. Alternatively, we are also available to schedule a call at your convenience if you prefer. Please let us know your preference, and we will be glad to arrange it.

Please inform us if there is an additional contact person who should receive this report or if you have any further questions. 

Wishing you a wonderful day!
