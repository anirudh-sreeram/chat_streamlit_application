Creation date: 2023-04-10 18:57:12 work_notes: BP has been experiencing this issue with the docking station since June 2021 when he received it. It was checked three times in August 2021, but the issue was not fixed. The workaround was suggested that the battery in the docking station should be removed and replaced whenever the issue came up.

Thunderbolt controller driver and Lenovo Dock Firmware package were installed
I attached one odd error in Schannel event logs
Power adapter error was observed in his next startup.
Requested the user to verify the power adapter
Shared a pic of the dock and power adapter for reference
He clarified they are the same.
Closing the ticket as this issue doesn't come up regularly.
Informed the user to reach out if he has any other issues
**********************************************

CP says that they have been removing and replacing the battery themselves whenever this happens. 
Power cord wattage: 110w
Docking station Model: WD27DC - Cord fixed to connect to PC
SVBM w/p to PC73821
 -  CP shared a pic of power error message from phone to their email ** See attachment **

Unable to resolve the issue in May of 2021 - only a temporary fix - but the temporary fix was very inconvenient - to remove the battery and replace it every time CP came back home to dock. 
Issue NEVER occurs at other docking station in the Clinton SC office. 

Sending to BPS Deskside to assess.
