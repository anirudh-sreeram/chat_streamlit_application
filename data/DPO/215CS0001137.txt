Hi,

We have identified certificates with overdue premiums to decrease the number of cancellations due to non-payment. Please review the attached spreadsheet and inform us about the payment status and whether you want the certificate to remain in force or if you prefer to cancel the coverage. Please note that certain state insurance departments have issued emergency orders regarding the postponement of premium payments. We are complying with all applicable orders for insured individuals and beneficiaries in those states. If this report is not relevant to your responsibilities, please forward it to the appropriate individuals who can assist. Thank you for your attention to this matter, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.
