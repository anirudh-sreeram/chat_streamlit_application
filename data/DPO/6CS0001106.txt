Good morning SHIELD,

Please check our customer JUKETV's email below. This appears to be a closing problem between JUKETV and SHIELD on how this PMI certificate was configured, and NEXBANK is unable to change the certificate because we did not produce it. Please contact JUKETV to discuss this matter, since they have requested a revision to this certificate.


Thanks!

Good morning Ollie,

The "s" in Rapids is missing from this certificate. View the snippet below. When I directly asked Denwick/SHIELD for revision, they responded that the cert had already been corrected and that I would need to get the updated certificate from my current servicer. 

Would you kindly supply the certificate with the following city: Cedar Rapids.

Thanks

Hi Ollie,

Please direct me to the appropriate agency or provide me with the revised MI certificate with the corrected city of Cedar Rapids.

SHIELD notified me that the desired change had been completed; nevertheless, I still needed to get the MI certificate from NEXBANK, the current loan servicer.

Thanks
