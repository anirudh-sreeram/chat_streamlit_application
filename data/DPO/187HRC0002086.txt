Hi Maryam,

I got your follow-up email. Would you kindly give me a call? These students' onboarding is done slightly differently, which is better to explain over the phone.

Thanks,

Halle

Subject: Students Starting at Immaculate Conception High in 2022 2023

Hello Kiana, it's that time of year again. Immaculate Conception High students will be enrolling with us on August 25th for the 2022 and 2023 academic year. I wanted to communicate with you about the onboarding procedure, so I sent the following details.


I provided the information below.<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://docs.google.com/spreadsheetshttps://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.linkedin.com/company/crowdstrikeholdingsinc.com In@#$%9876544gMt_FR42WkD9csi9Y!akKzMrDaCiC31TWhzasKVJN_ylGbX-JSjITpICiZvql96BRxVYKQd257CFaDR4mexTRlNAvQCFg2rm20w-XqJWWCSi78kc7-Zumv$ may you share the PDF of our NDA with the school so that it may provide it to the parents of the children so they can see it before the students sign the electronic version? Is there anything I still need to collect for the students from last year about the information you required me to gather?

Could you please clarify how students will receive laptops?

Many thanks,

Apologies I reviewed previous onboardings and discovered that we waive the background check for these employees. We would simply need the remaining items, but I will be out of the office for the rest of the day. If we can start working on the other items, we can set a time to talk if it's necessary.
