Hello Ray,

I trust all is well,

I am unable to assist you with SAP related issues, but Mila Dixon, who is the GBP HR Supervisor, she might be able to help you.

Mila, Can you please look into Ray's problem ?


Thanks

Topic: Alivia Cortez is the proxy for Keisha Winter

Hello Hanna,

Do you know the person I should contact to have SAP approvals routed from Keisha Winter to Alivia Cortez? Alivia's team no longer includes Keisha. Although I don't believe that is your responsibility, I believe you assisted me with a similar issue in the past.


Thanks,

Ray

Hello Ray -
Would you raise a GBP ticket on my name, so that I can take Keisha's proxy?

Hello Alivia,

In my opinion, you'll have to submit a GBP ticket and request Keisha's proxy. I am unable to send it your way.

Thanks.

Regards,

Jasmin
