One of the Monitor is not working
Make and model of dock:-D3100
PC make and model:- Lenovo Legion S7

gpupdate /force
sfc /scannow
Updated dock driver
updated graphics driver

Monitor is not detecting it is turning on
There is no other input on the monitor

When connected the monitor directly to the system  instead of going through the dock 
It is not working 

Asked BP to change the cable
Asked BP to connect to a different connector on the dock
 It did not work

Please help BP
Creation date: 2023-04-10 14:58:01 work_notes: Looks like a bad cable or monitor.  Also, if BP is using a D3100 for a Lenovo Legion S7 he should be using a WD18.  There is a power fluctuation  so that could be a problem as well.

Ciara,

I got assigned to this ticket to resolve the problem you are facing  with a monitor and possible office dock, and I understand that the nearest office location is the London UK. I will be in the London UK office tomorrow after 9:00AM and can meet you then if that's okay for you. If not tomorrow I will be back on Monday 3/14. Please let me know which date works for you and will need you to bring in the monitor and office dock and I will replace them.


Thank you
