Happy afternoon,
See the urgent request for a rebate check below.

The check request is attached - please code to GL2012099 Branch 6653011
The cash team is now attempting to clear the CM in Trilogie to GL2012. As soon as I have confirmation from that team, I will forward the batch number.

Please remember to send the check to the branch overnight as well.

The request was submitted by Central Operations to  AUTUNAIR. centrala ccounting for the check to be sent for the rebate.      I want these via emergency check, along with the two emails related to this.
Could you please indicate whether this may be cut today or whether it needs to go to an emergency check request. Our customer is furious.
