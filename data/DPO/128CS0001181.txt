A case was opened with a short description of Problems with WVD / AVD through Nerdio
A longer description includes Working with Nerdio to resolve this issue with a build out of a windows virtual desktop deployment. Session host / host pool runs for a bit and then crashes and needs to be re-imaged.

I've started from scratch with a new desktop image and a new host pool and session post but problems continue anyway.

Nerdio is telling me to talk to Azure Support and Azure Support told me Nimbus is where I should start with the troubleshooting.

Not sure where the breakdown is happening in the pipeline but I can replicate the problem for troubleshooting.

Thank you for contacting Nimbus Tech Help.  I'm Jemima Gates, one of the Infrastructure Engineers working at Nimbus. I'll be assisting you with your request today. Can you first confirm the following for me so I can provide you with the best assistance? What is your ID number for Nerdio and which version of Nerdio are you using?

Thank you
Jemima

Is this environment one that is newly deployed? If no when did this issue begin happening and how many effected users are there many users and also affecting the production environment? There also do not appear to be any health issues in Azure, when you say it crashes what do you mean?


Jemima
Creation date: 2022-09-27 13:47:49 comments: Hello it s  a little difficult to explain as we don't know what the problem is but I ll give as many details as possible.

This environment is brand new, all users are being affected and the environment was meant to go into production yesterday.

A cloud hosted file server / domain controller ad is synced with Azure AD. There are no issues with AD Sync on both the cloud and on the azure ad connect service on the server.

A desktop image was built and it was applied to a host pool with no autoscaling enabled at the moment. The image is all up to date, has no errors and does not exhibit any of the issues that occur when its applied to a session host.

Once the imaged and session host is live, users can connect to it without issue but they then become unable to connect if a credential is changed. It seems there's something wrong with directory permissions / credential but I checked that credential write back and hash synchronization are all functioning without issue. There are some accounts that just won't connect period credential reset or no.

There's another problem in that if the session host is powered down automatically or manually via Azure, the vm itself or nerdio, the session host vm reports that the Microsoft Windows virtual agent isn't available when we attempt to turn it back on. The only way to fix this is to reimage the host pool.

I think there's an issue with Azure AD and the directory syncing but that could be way off.

When it does work, it's perfect, until it stops working and when that happens, no warnings are given in advance.

Helps to have all that info thank you. I don't see any errors with Ad sync. Kindly request that you provide the Event viewer logs. Might show an error that can assist us with shedding light on the AVD.

My test account,
oskar.pacheco@ARTfit.com<mailto:oskar.pacheco@ARTfit.com> won't let me connect to the session host anymore which hasn't happened before. Any logs regarding why we cant connect would be fantastic.

Whats the best way I can get the logs to you? I can attach it here if that's ok with you

You can attach here using a zip file. If I don't receive it, I can send you a OneDrive link where you can upload it . Where and how are you modifying user credentials? I can see Self-Service crashes (OnPremisesPolicyViolation).

The doc was attached on the last email but if you didn't receive it go ahead and send me a onedrive link.

Is there a bulletproof way to quick reset a credential to an azure ad joined windows virtual desktop environment that is synced to an onprem / cloudhosted server/

MOREOVER, Nerdio told us that we have to do hybrid AD in order to properly support traditional file sharing.

Can you also forward me the FSLogix logs. You can locate them in %ProgramData%\FSLogix\Logs\Profile.

Jemima
Creation date: 2022-09-27 14:26:29 comments: Oskar,

I noticed the FSLogix profiles are in containers blob storage and not AzureFiles. It is not recommended you do this. Can you share the document you used to set this up?

OneDrive Link is here.

https://nimbus-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/p/jgates/Tnvw2rRgdEdTmlNB2TdTzIFBllSHUyqqtpgwvo-4XfPWCw?q=YRgkW2

Also we typically flag production environment down as critical cases, so since this is a new one I am going to reduce the case to "High".

Creation date: 2022-09-27 14:27:27 comments: There you go, its only 1 since it was reimaged not too long ago.

The machine is currently online but its not letting me sign in, possibly due to somethign with the credential resets but the website I email you was working fine for me and the users yesterday before the server crashed.

Creation date: 2022-09-27 14:33:16 comments: I do agree with you, but the users were supposed to start working in a new production environment yesterday. So I would still mark this as critical since they were supposed to be working in on it during our go live yesterday. I know there's a procedure you're meant to follow ive just been getting the short end of the stick with Nerdio wanting nothing to do with it, telling us to talk to azure support and now i'm back with nimbus its been tiring. 

Man, life in IT.

As for fslogix being in blob storage, Nerdio told us to do that per the following:

https://help.nerdio.net/hd/ea-us/articles/7062365286265-Blob-Storage-FSLogix-Profiles

Thanks for the onedrive link sent those logs over.

I can also replicate the session host vm "crash" but after it fails, I cant access the vm at all or pull any logs from it but you can still see it in azure
