Regarding this, should I have paid them already? Is this the last check run, or will they be on the next one?

Thank you!

Hi Ursula,



I still do not see in our imaging system the invoices that are missing from receipt. To help me troubleshoot why they might not have gone through, kindly supply the emails where they were sent. We still require responses for the remaining items on the statement. I have indicated this in various colors:


Red items: must be removed from our account.

Yellow items: require more details or credit before Cepagras Meter will issue them.

Green items: bills paid or scheduled to be paid in our system

Orange items: invoices set/paid to be paid in the system

3RD REQUEST.



Good Afternoon Ursula,



After looking over the supplied table, I made the spreadsheet that is attached and included my comments to each item. Upon reviewing the account, the following are some important insights:

 * A few invoices have been fully paid for, and the checks have cleared, but the remaining amount of the invoices remains unpaid. Kindly confirm that you got these checks and let us know if you require any more information.
 * A few balances remain unidentified. In order for me to review these in more detail, kindly review them and send the check information that was used.
 * For your review, I have included copies of every debit memo I could find open on the statement.
  *   There are several missing copies of the invoice. The instructions for submitting invoices are given below. please send those over for processing.
  *   A small proportion of invoices had the wrong invoice number entered. On the statement, I have mentioned how they were entered and the checks they were paid.
  *   There are some tax and discount balances. Please check those that need to be cleared.

Mina -

Your name came to me from Naplino Sittaro. Our Cepagras Meter is not working properly, and our account has been put on hold. Kindly note that the following things are past due. I am not sure if these were missed in some way, or if we paid but failed to submit accurate information.


Although Berta may already be working on this, a few important orders are being put on hold while we resolve these issues. I would be grateful for any assistance, and I am fully prepared to assist you in any way I can.

Thank you -

Brandon
