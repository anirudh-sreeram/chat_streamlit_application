Can you kindly alter the MI certificate to reflect the quote's 0.35%?

Lender Services Hub,

Can a special payment letter be given on what the cost to cure would be at 0.34% instead of 0.35%?

Hi Larry, good day!  There's a bit of an issue in that we quoted MI at .34% but the certificate came back at .36%. I pulled the Edicta quote again using the current ratios (a bit higher than our original quote) and the factor is .35% (quote from today is enclosed). Can we get the cert we were sent today updated to match the new quote, .35%? Finally, we are working on getting more up-to-date income doc's to see if the borrow has more income, but while that's happening, can we get the cost to cure once the cert is updated and reissued at .35%? Want to see how much the cost to cure is for a factor of .34% and how much moola this is going to cost.


Thanks!  ??
