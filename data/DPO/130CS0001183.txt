A case was opened with a short description of CybSecure problem
A longer description includes I am having problems with CybSecure. Nothing happens when I release an email out of quarantine. I click on the message, select Release From Quarantine, click GO, the button goes grey, but nothing happens afterward. It's not frozen, it's just there. If I unselect and select again, and hit go, exact same outcome. Nothing. This occurred two times today already. I need to get these emails released from quarantine.

I left you a voicemail when I called. My name is Maliha and I'm a Level 2 technical support engineer with the Nimbus email security team.
Martin Price created a case, but Neufort Systems, Inc. doesn't list his account as a contact on the Nimbus platform. It's listed in the customer tenant in CybSecure instead.

Can you kindly confirm that
Martin Price
IT Specialist
mprice@caplandco.com<mailto:mprice@caplandco.com> is a partner-level employee with you?

I appreciate your help and time!
Thanks and Regards,
Maliha

Creation date: 2022-09-22 15:57:56 comments: Thanks for the response. Martin is one of my clients' IT support.
Can you transfer the case so it is in my name and I will speak with him?

We have seen this happen if the email is marked for Fraud and the user uses the "Release and Approve" function rather than "Release from quaratine"

Release and approve will add the sender to a safe sender whitelist and is not permitted for email marked for Fraud. If there is anything else we can help with, please reach out and thank you for your patience and your time!

Yes, we tried that before but it doesn't allow me to do that.
[image002.png]

I can release from quarantine, but nothing happens, the go button goes grey, and nothing happens after. The Go button will undim if I click elsewhere on the page. I tried this in other browsers, too so it's not a browser issue. I've also signed out and signed back into CybSecure, same thing. This is not an issue on my end, there's something wrong with CybSecure. I have also tried this on multiple users quarantined messages. This needs to be fixed, I have people waiting to receive their emails.

Just phoned and left a voicemail at the Capland Co number that's in the case description. I requested permalinks of the emails that are stuck in quarantine or a screen recording of the issue being rep]roduced since we can release emails from quarantine on our side of the environment and other customers/partners haven't reported having this issue.

Thank you for any info that you may have!

Nimbus called and informed me that I should speak with you instead of them. They requested permalinks of the email that I can't release from quarantine.

I can't release anything currently, but sharing links here for the ones I need as soon as possible. As I mentioned, it doesn't what I choose to release, nothing ever happens. The Go button goes grey, and that's all. The Go button seem to be working at all.
