A case was opened with a short description of Data Lake Lab table needs to be restored.
A longer description includes Please assign to: IT INFR-IBM DATABASE SUPPORT
On this project, I'm collaborating with Abel Newton. I submitted a ticket at his instruction.

I should have AL_OpsPerformanceBusSvcs_Analytics.hq_core_metrics_weekly restored using Saturday, 4/15 @ 4pm restore.
The current table, which is used for DOR graphics, should not be overwritten with the restored data.

Thanks!

hello

[12:03 AM] Gordon Boone
I was tasked with escalating INC1991884 by Henri Maddox.

[12:03 AM] Gordon Boone
I'm contacting Carly Stafford and Cruz Mclean

[12:03 AM] Gordon Boone
but why is this a P4 (low priority) ticket in zendesk

[12:04 AM] Gordon Boone
If it affects business DORs, it should be at least a P3.....
Creation date: 2023-04-17 15:35:36 work_notes: A higher attention should be given to P2, as it is connected to the Lab database's Production table and is utilized by numerous departments for DOR. This occurrence will be used to implement immediate change.

I verified yesterday that the group was able to rebuild the iSchedule table in the system using the restored table AL_OpsPerformanceBusSvcs_Analytics schema yesterday.  We don't require the AL_OpsPerformanceBusSvcs_Analytics_New schema.

I appreciate your quick reply from yesterday!
