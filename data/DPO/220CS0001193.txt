Hello Jordan, 

Fine, please do so. The partner requested an update regarding the status of the orders (KSY Builders has 2). Could you provide this update so I can let them know? They say they were given a temporary license but it's due to expire soon and they don't have the new one yet.

Thanks for your time! 
Bruno Hayden

What's the current status on this order? Kindly provide us with a Temporary Key so that we can get this job going.

Without this key, we can't do much with the job. Please call if you have any questions, concerns, this has to get fixed today as soon as possible.

Thanks a lot,

I will connect with one of them and figure out the case status. I'll see about the temp and ask if it can be done. Yesterday, I sent an email yesterday but I never got any response. I will update you once I get response. 

Thank you so much!
