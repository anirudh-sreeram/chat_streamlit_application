Okay. Thank you for providing the information. The FSlogix (version 2.9.8171.14983) you have has issue delay with certain processes, namely cache and container redirection.
Please update apply latest hotfix for FSlogix and see what happens.

Is it necessary that I log into each session host and update? What do I do with VM-IV-FSAPP02?

Creation date: 2022-09-23 14:02:12 comments:  Do I need to reboot the server as well?
Creation date: 2022-09-23 14:23:49 comments: Milo,

Yes, you will also need to reboot each server FSLogix fix applied.
 VM-IV-FSAPP02 is a VDHx shared and FSlogix profile redirection. You can check if  FSLogix   installed on this VM and perform update.
 If you have any questions, please let us know.

Thank you,

Tharan
Creation date: 2022-09-23 18:22:07 comments: Thank you, Tharan. Updated FSLogix app. I'll check again after rebooting.
 The reason I want to include the attached email is because I have another problem. I'm looking for a specific INI file in a user's profile that doesn't get transferred when the session ends, and they log back into an app called "Ascend" used by employees. Did you gain any insight from reviewing these emails from our partners and teams? We'll continue to let you know if the FSLogix update helps with any other problems we have been experiencing.

Thank you,


Milo Brogan
Creation date: 2022-09-23 18:41:01 comments: Hello Milo,

Great! Thanks for updating FSlogix. I looked into the ASEND-HI. IINI from the AScend user account. It may relate to the previous old FSlogix version which had latency and App redirect from App server VM-IV-FSAPP02.

Hope FSlogix hotfix and all reboots and updating concurs that problem too.


Please let me know if you have other problems.

Thanks,

Tharan
Creation date: 2022-09-23 18:46:50 comments: Tharan,

I believe there is another INI file that is not being transferred between profiles. The Ascend support rep thinks so, too.
Creation date: 2022-09-23 18:51:26 comments: Milo,

Can you confirm with the Vendor, does this INI printer driver needed administrator privileges for every user profile redirect through FSLogix?

Thank you,

Tharan
Creation date: 2022-09-23 19:06:10 comments: As far as I know, that's not the case. I believe there are two INI files that store custom printer settings. I just can't locate the second file. The first file saves the logout/login changes correctly, but this second file containing the form placement print properties does not. Every time the user logs back into the cloud, the settings are reset, so this second INI file is either deleted or not included in the user's VHD for FSlogix. I will check with the team.
Creation date: 2022-09-23 19:17:05 comments: Milo,

Got it. I appreciate you looking into it.Please update me.

Thank you,

Users are still freezing when they try to log into remote desktop or WVD. They're stuck at the "Please wait" screen. the fact that they are still in production hours has prevented us from rebooting. Most recently user Journey Moore
Creation date: 2022-09-23 19:24:42 comments: Milo,

Those WVDs must be rebooted. Would you be able to reboot after work hours? And inform me if any problems continue.

Thank you,

Tharan
Creation date: 2022-09-26 12:04:43 comments: Hi Milo,

I hope everything is well. I just wanted to see how things were progressing and to follow up with you on this case.

Were you and your group able to reboot WVDs and apply the most recent FSLogix updates? What about user login?

 Is there anything more I can help you with right now?

Thanks,

Tharan
Creation date: 2022-09-26 13:40:05 comments: Tharan,

I've heard nothing from the client, but hopefully today. Thank you. On Thursday, we updated the app and rebooted the servers.
Creation date: 2022-09-26 13:41:17 comments: Hello Milo,

Wonderful! reach out if there are any problems.

Thank you,

Tharan
Creation date: 2022-09-27 12:15:20 comments: The frequency of the problems remained same. They seem to be continuing to occur.
Creation date: 2022-09-27 12:41:09 comments: Hi Milo,

I understand. Thank you for sharing that the problem still exists even after you updated FSlogix to the most recent version on all WVDs. Having said that, I don't want to waste any more time, therefore I believe the best course of action in this situation would be to speak with Microsoft support directly to see if they can confirm that the patch can be completed on their end.


I can begin working on that matter, but before I do, could you please clarify if you prefer to communicate with Microsoft via phone or email? What's the best phone number for them to contact you at, if via phone?

I can open this case for you as soon as I obtain the information!

Thank you,

Tharan

Creation date: 2022-09-27 13:44:40 comments: Hi Milo,

I have forwarded ticket 3310381121113168 to Microsoft in order to escalate it. I will also be transferring the Nimbus ticket to our Vendor Support team in order to guarantee that the Microsoft escalation process continues as planned. You may expect to hear from another Nimbus engineer soon. 

Thank you,

We are waiting for our local representative to return from vacation so far, I haven't received many calls so I would like to leave this case open for a little while, but please bear with me.

Are the listed disconnected the same as those caused by Group Policy? We have a policy of disconnecting/terminating sessions after 30 minutes of inactivity. This is how we handled users not wanting to properly end their sessions by logging out, which was causing further problems.

Thank you,
