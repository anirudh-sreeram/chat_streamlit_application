Good noon,

I got a notification regarding the impending conclusion of my SAP assignment within two days (it was dispatched yesterday). I've been absent from my computer this week and am inquiring if an extension can be granted before the specified closure occurs without my intervention. Is it possible to prolong it until friday? I would appreciate the opportunity to review the whole content initially. 

Kindly provide guidance.

Ashley Camacho
