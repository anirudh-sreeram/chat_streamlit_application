Good afternoon,

Please check this branch they are stating when calling another branch via 711 and visa versa the end party cannot hear the branch. They also stated CLASS has been freezing all morning. Was this branch upgraded on Thursday?

Thank you!

Good afternoon,

Could you kindly take a look at this branch? They conveyed that the receiver cannot hear when they call another branch via 741 and the other way round. They also conveyed that CLASS has been freezing throughout morning. Was this branch upgraded on Thursday?

Thank you!
