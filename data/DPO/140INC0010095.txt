Good afternoon,

Could kindly check this branch to see if anything is happening. They say today applications are taking longer than usual to load. How long have they been up?

Thank you,

The update time that I can see is 13 days. Additionally, I've noticed 2 brownouts on the Primary Connection in the past 36 hours.
