A case was opened with a short description of RE: Outlook Web Problems - Drafts [NIM5393936]
A longer description includes Hello,

Following up on our email thread below in regards to this issue, it seems the solution we were given was only temporary and the problem as resurfaced.

Could we log this with Microsoft so we can work towards a permanent solution, please? It's causing some serious issues for them right now.

Thank you,

Creation date: 2022-09-30 09:15:59 comments: Hello Thea,

Sorry the issue came back.

Have you looked at the current status of the following settings on the mailbox in PowerShell?

-MessageCopyForSendOnBehalfEnabled
-MessageCopyForSentAsEnabled

Did these revert to false?

May I know if this is happening to all sent items (as was the case previously) or only some?

Once these have been checked, I'd be happy to raise this with Microsoft on your behalf.

Kindly share the details below for someone at your company:

Name
Email address
Contact Number
Availability

Kindly add the UPN of the affected mailbox as well

It would also be great to have evidence that one of the outbound emails currently in drafts was actually sent out. Please include an extended message trace for one of the outgoing emails.

Thank you,
Oscar

Creation date: 2022-10-05 14:01:42 comments: Hello,

I looked into it and the settings did not revert as everything is still set to 'True'

It seems to be affecting all emails - after the initial change, everything was functioning normally but around the 2-week mark, we started experiencing the issue again

As for contact info, this is a pretty hazy area since the people using this inbox are a sub-company which we do not actually support with respect to IT. They have their own IT company and I'm not sure if I can share this information with you for a number of reasons.

Thanks for providing clarity on this issue..

The contact details I request to provide to Microsoft are either your own or someone at your company. Microsoft does not like have customers as contacts on cases and will only reach out if absolutely necessary. Rather they require an MSP-level contact to operate as the technical contact.

Are you able to provide the below info for yourself or someone at Panco IT?

Name
Email address
Contact Number
Availability

Thank you,

 Hello Thea,

Really sorry for the late response.

The diagnostics were run, which executed the following actions:

  Checks for synchronization failures in recipient object.
  Attempts to resolve any synchronization failures that were found.
  Checks for synchronization conflicts on recipient or list of recipients.
  Attempts to any synchronization conflicts that were found.
  Starts a synchronization from EXO to Azure.

I would advise you to remove the license on the mailbox since it is shared. You can look at the behavior and share your results with us.

If you continue to have problems, run the PowerShell script shared below and share your results with us.

 Hello,
 
Thanks for responding on this issue.
 
Kindly see the answers for your questions below. 

How many users are experiencing this problem? Everyone who logs into/uses this mailbox (around 30+ people).
When did this problem begin? From last 7 weeks onwards.
Were changes that could result  in this behavior? No changes were made.
What environment do you have? Hybrid or Cloud only? Hybrid though I think the issue is happening in OWA
Kindly share UPN for affected user customersupport@pcit.co.us 
What is the behavior in OWA? The issue is in OWA since they do not have outlook access. OWA is how they log in and use emails

Unfortunately, I just heard from the user that this did not seem to fix the issue.

We converted it into a standard mailbox again and added a license too but the drafts still aren't disappearing as sent, just building up.

The drafts folder contained around 320 messages yesterday and has around 420, as of five minutes ago with the user reaching out to me directly.

Actually, the command normally lists all the properties on the mailbox.

Kindly have a look at this article, if you are not confident:

Hello,

I just wanted to know, is this command takes away any permissions to the mailbox? actually I am asking this one because I see a pert of it used the phrase format list.

Currently, as too many users are having access to this mailbox, it is vital that permissions are not to modified or remove them all and etc.
