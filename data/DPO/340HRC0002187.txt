Subject: RE: Automated proposals - authorized individuals in Switzerland.

Hello, Pearl

I appreciate your email and the enclosed revision of the signatories. Could you kindly create a ticket in Zendesk for this modification? It's important for us to have a ticket to fulfill our auditing obligations. Once you provide me with the ticket number, I will take responsibility for the necessary actions.

I'm willing to conduct a session on the procedure, during which I can present a comprehensive SAP demonstration. Could you please specify the participants you'd prefer, and I will search for an appropriate date and time. 

Warm Wishes.

Jayson

Subject: Automated proposals - authorized individuals in Switzerland.

Hi Jayson,I had a conversation last Friday with Armaan Duncan, our Senior Legal Counsel, and Blaese Oakley, our Finance Director.

We kindly request to rearrange the order of signatory 1 and 2.
Essentially, all contracts should initially be directed to me before proceeding to signature 2.

Attached is the file containing the updated SAP configuration.
Would you please implement these modifications?

Additionally, we are inquiring whether there is an opportunity to arrange a 30-minute informational session regarding the automated process with either yourself or another knowledgeable individual who can provide an overview of the entire process and setup.
As previously stated, I am uncertain about the individuals engaged in this procedure, but from my perspective, it appears that approximately half of the individuals listed in the attachment were unaware of this going live.

Thank you once more for your generous assistance, and warm wishes, Pearl

I've revised the authorized individuals to align with your requested modifications. I will arrange a distinct session to illustrate the entire procedure as per your request. It might need to take place in a few weeks since my current availability is restricted, and I have a week of leave approaching, but I will determine an appropriate date.
I'll modify this ticket with the suggested solution. 

Much appreciated.

Jayson'.
