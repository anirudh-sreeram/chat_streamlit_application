I had a discussion with one of our senior engineers today, and he explained that concerning Azure sync, Guardwall only implements the changes reported by azure sync. There might be an issue with your sync configuration on the Office 365 side, causing it not to report spelling changes or alias deletion to Guardwall.
If you need assistance in troubleshooting this matter, I can help from the Guardwall side. Please inform me if you would like further assistance.
Thanks,
Joseph

Joseph,

We have observed that two distribution groups are not visible in the Guardwall portal, and messages sent to them are not bouncing.

Does the synchronization process include updating distribution groups?

Creation date: 2022-10-05 18:34:42 comments: Hello Bob,
I have been informed of a current bug in Guardwall where the scheduled sync is not initiating as per the specified frequency setting. I noticed that the last Azure sync ran yesterday at 9:10 PM. 
The Guardwall development team is actively addressing this issue and working on releasing a fix, although there is no specific release data available yet. Regarding your inquiry, I suggest attempting a manual sync to check if those distribution groups are transferred.
Thanks,
Joseph

If you provide me with the distribution lists name, and e-mail addresses, along with a screenshot displaying the account details from the exchange admin, I can escalate the issue to Guardwall for further investigation. Alternatively, you also have the option to manually add the distribution list.

Alternatively, you also have the option to manually add the distribution list.
