Thank you for contacting Nimbus Support. My name is Esme Todd, and I am a member of the Infrastructure Support group. Could you kindly share the documentation you referred to when setting this up? Additionally, can you describe any errors or issues you encounter when attempting to run the script?
Creation date: 2022-10-06 15:38:28 comments: Hello Esme,

Kindly find the description below provided by the client:

I have attempted to execute this script on multiple servers. The primary problem with both servers is that it halts at a specific point and fails to continue any further.
Server 1, an ESXi VM on a host connected to the vCenter. I m never asked to sign into Azure.
Kindly login to Azure CLI.
                * If you are running the script for the initial time please, choose yes.
                 *If you have logged into Azure just before running the script, you can select no.

Do you confirm login to azure cli?
Yes(y)/No(n)?: y


Server 2, a Hyper-V VM that is on the vCenter server's network. I successfully completed the Azure login but when it reaches the resource deployment stage for bridge, it pauses and does not prompt me for credentials.
==> Please furnish vCenter details for deploying the Arc resource bridge VM. The provided credential will be utilized by the Arc resource bridge to manage updates and scaling.

Regarding the Azure account:
1. Are there multiple users linked to the subscription? Yes, there are. I am one of the owners of the subscription, however.

2. Is the current user granted administrator permissions? Yes, I am using my account, which is an owner of the subscription and has permissions inherited by all organizational units. Additionally, I hold the role of domain admin within the domain on the server from which I am running this script, and I am also an administrator involved in the vCenter onboarding process.
1. Can you observe the resource creation process? No, I cannot. Resources are never created in vCenter or Azure.
2. If so, do their resources vanish or persist? Are you able to utilize them? N/A, For further details on the expected behavior, this script is intended to deploy a VM in vCenter that establishes a connection to Azure arc. This connection should enable the visibility and management of all VMs in vCenter through the VM deployed in vCenter.
