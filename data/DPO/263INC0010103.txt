Good afternoon,

Currently at OKE, Kim-Que Aving's calls are not being recorded. Would you kindly investigate this matter?

Thank you,

Queen Shefali

I still can't seem to find her. I have attempted searching by name, agent ID, and even the interaction IDs on the sample you provided.

There are no search choices that turn her up. Could you confirm that I receive every agent who reports to me for the Oxford site?

Hi Queen! 

This month, there are 4 calls that I can see that were all made today. 
 

Can you try searching using her Agent or Station ID? 
agent id: 9057116
station id: 7707118

Yes, now I am available.

Okay, kindly accept all pop-up windows

I changed the filter to This Month's call recordings since she hasn't recorded any calls today

That's really odd, but thank you very much. Firoz couldn't locate her on my computer, either, hehe

Not an issue! At times it is funny that BMLIT may be rather selective in its search results! However, I'm delighted it's working now! I hope you have a great day and let me know if there's anything more I can do to assist!
