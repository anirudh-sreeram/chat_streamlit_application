Updated email.
Creation date: 2022-10-03 21:27:07 comments: Hi Oscar,

In order to recap our communication, we discussed the emails that were missing and the different choices that we have for recovery.   
I and my team verified this and it is going to escalate to Microsoft. 
In order to escalate we need a couple of things. 

The emails are treated as recoverable because they can be found in E-Discovery. 
This can be verified through:  - > https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/security-and-compliance/recoverable-items-folder/recoverable-items-folder
After getting confirmation, you are required to write up a business justification letter mentioning the problem and reason for making this request.   
Once we get that- Premier support will connect with PG, it seems like it is going to sort itself out but nothing is confirmed. 

We will follow up with this case and update you regarding the current status. 
If you wish to contact us our support hours are 24/7 and our contact number is 855-884-8309 Ext. 2.
Kindly contact us if you have any queries or concerns and if there are new developments!

Thank you so much and have a wonderful day!

Creation date: 2022-10-04 13:20:35 work_notes: Partner reached out abut the business justification and was asking what it was. I might be missing details so I don't know. Was this not under their currently owned tenant or something?

I guess I just don't understand why a justification is needed if they can just use ediscovery to recover it? Unless it's broken?

Binny, if you could just help me out here. I told them they can submit the justification here though.
Creation date: 2022-10-04 13:37:11 comments: I have added the business justification letter describing the problem and the reason this request was made.

Please reach out if additional info is needed.

Creation date: 2022-10-04 14:06:23 work_notes: Partner called to verify that the info provided was sufficient to send up to Microsoft
Binny was unavailable and I'm not certain what the purpose of this business justification is
Creation date: 2022-10-04 15:00:38 comments: Hi Oscar,

I wanted to touch base and clarify some miscommunication so we're all on the same page and understand what's happening.
With regards to escalation, we will escalate to Premier support but not as far as Product Group.
Unfortunately there isn't a magic fix that can resolve this problem.
Product Group will incur a charge so will not be involved in this case.
Apologies for the inconvenience and not setting the correct expectations from the get-go
I have the correct information from upper management and this is our way forward

Hey Rhonda,

I really appreciate your time during the call,

As discussed, you let us know there was a bad actor in the tenant who wrote a transport rule that deleted emails without notification to anyone in the tenant. We are unable to view the emails in the quarantine portal too

We will look into this and provide an update.

The last email on our end is the same one that he saw so I said I could send an email if he'd like. He said he was fine with that, so I reached out to Microsoft again this morning:

Good morning Jodie,

I hope you are doing well. Oscar contacted us this morning, requesting an update.

Could you please give an update or connect with Oscar sometime if possible?

Thanks!

"As discussed in our previous conversation, the customer told us that a transport rule was created in the tenant that deleted the external emails without notification. We looked into this on our end as well. The emails cannot be recovered because they never reached the user's inbox. We could have recovered them if they had reached the users inbox.

The emails were deleted with notification. This made to happen by design of the transport rule which was created in the tenant."

Please let us know if there are any discrepancies
