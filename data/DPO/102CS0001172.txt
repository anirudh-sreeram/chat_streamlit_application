A case was opened with a short description of Viva Trial cannot be canceled and I will be billed tomorrow
A longer description includes This trial was never active. The max number of users was 25 but I put 50.
Reported this issue and requested a fix, was never resolved.
Now i am being informed that i will be billed for these licenses tomorrow but i am unable to cancel the trial. 
Screenshot for reference.
Kindly provide guidance on this matter

You should now have the ability to cancel it on your own as we made some modifications to the system.
Creation date: 2022-10-07 13:29:51 comments: Hi Anita,

Were you able to cancel it or do you require any help with this?
Creation date: 2022-10-07 14:11:03 comments: The NCE subscription has extended for a year, and I am unable to cancel it before October 6, 2023.

Please ensure that it is cancelled according to the date I initiated the cancellation request to prevent any issues!

Regards

The subscription is not present in Microsoft's partner center, but we will address this issue promptly in our hub. Rest assured, you will not be billed for it, and if you receive an invoice mistakenly, we will promptly issue a refund. We will investigate and update you on the status by Sunday.

I will inform you once the problem has been resolved.

If there are no issues with the invoice, please inform me; otherwise, everything seems to be resolved and we can close the ticket.
Creation date: 2022-10-12 11:14:10 comments: Thank you all for your assistance. 

You may proceed to close the ticket.
