Hey, Yoder
Don't we pay taxes?
We're merely suppliers, not end users, right?
See attached.
Thank you

Hello everyone
Why wasn't the state tax on these bills short paid, I wonder? This initiative is neither a government employment, nor is it free from taxes. Kindly pay for these as soon as you are able to.

Due amount for PO number 4098-3198 is $896.34.
PO R 4098-33788$ 899.52 is the amount owed.

With gratitude
