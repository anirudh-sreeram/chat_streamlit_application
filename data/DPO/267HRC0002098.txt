Hello Alisa,

I believe our system classifies you, Douglas, and Randy as contingent workers; therefore, you must complete the forms in order to keep access to OneLogin.

<mailto:alparrish@forcepoint.com>@Alisa Parrish - As opposed to a supplier agency for contingent workers, Stage4 is a marketing firm (similar like ZiftONE Zift Solutions, etc.). Given that their SOWs identify Stage4 as a marketing agency, are Douglas, Randy, and Alisa required to sign the forms, or is the exemption request form an alternative?
