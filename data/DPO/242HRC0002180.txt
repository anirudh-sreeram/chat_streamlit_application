Subject: RE: Salary increment and Promotion for Sr. PD

Hello Allen-

I have finished my investigation, and I suggest raising his salary by 15% ($13,456), bringing his total to $99,590. Additionally, his bonus goal increased to 12% with the promotion to P3.

Kindly share your thoughts with me.
Thank you,
Carla

Grant would see a 19% rise at $105K. Although this is the highest pay grade available, I will assist due to the flight risk.

Thank you,

Hi Carla and Kristina

I would like to assure that Grant will receive a competitive salary increase as a result of this promotion. The minimum salary for a Senior PD Engineer is $105,000, according to information provided to Betsy Weaver after she requested a separate examination of salarys for her team. Do you believe that $105k is a realistic or excessive offer in this circumstance?
yes or no and reasons for that?

Thank you,
