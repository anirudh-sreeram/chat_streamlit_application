Hello Ram,
 I apologize for any misunderstanding and appreciate the clarification. It appears that those logs were not generated for some reason. I will investigate that further as I examine the logs that have previously been supplied.
Thanks,

Hi again,
I have no problem sending the logs to you. In fact, I would be glad to do that if it was possible. The issue is that I am not even unable to get the console logs.
After I did as directed by these instructions:
https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/chrome-citrix-workspace-app/repair.htm
Step 1 for console logs instructs "open chrome://inspect/#apps". I could do this.
Step 2 instructs "Click on  inspect  in the Application tab for all Citrix Workspace-related windows: SessionWindow.html, Main.html"
Yet, as I mentioned in my earlier email, I can't see anything on that page. I can't even click on  inspect ; the page is absolutely blank. If I can't complete this stage, how can I obtain logs? I attempted this in Chrome on the VDI, as well as in Chrome in Storefront, and they both display the same thing.

How do I send console logs? When I navigate to that page's apps, there are no options listed.

Hello Ram,
Thanks for submitting the logs. I'll be working on getting our Engineering team to investigate the problem at the code level. They will most likely require the console logs, so please upload them as soon as possible.
Thanks,

Thanks for contacting us and sharing your input. This week Anurag is on leave, therefore I am keeping an eye on this case in his absence. 

Our internal actual team is actively working on this problem based on the internal communication I have seen. We requested that the latest version of CWA be installed because it contains some comparable and desired fixes 1) to determine  if those solutions  might take care of your problem and 2) if not, collect fresh logs with this updated version and continue your efforts to find a solution. 

To move on with a solution, we must collect an additional batch of logs. This does not imply  that you will have to hold off till the introduction of a new version. By examining the logs, we might be able to identify a fix without needing to update CWA. Having stated that, obtaining a new CWA version with remedy would be necessary if we discover that it is a bug. 

I am sorry for the delay in finding a solution and thank you for your patients as we work towards one. In order for me to give them to our internal team and continue  working toward a solution, I would appreciate it if you could gather another batch of logs and upload them for the time being. 

Best Regards,
Rishabh Meher

Good afternoon!
I was finally able to update the Citrix Workspace app to 33.10.0.10, but I still face the error message when I try to connect to a Teams meeting: It appears that the camera preview is linked because I can see myself there, but when I try to join the meeting, I get the " sorry, we couldn't connect you screen" message again.
Apart than gathering logs and waiting for a new version of the Citrix Workspace, is there anything further we can do? I've tried the Citrix version 4 times now, and each time I get the same issue.
Ram Shukla

Hi!
I'm working on this at the office today, but I'm having trouble getting the app to update. As it's a managed Chromebook, I'm not able to update it myself. I believe I have to wait for the administrator to push the update. I will get in touch with the administrator to ask him to push it to the device, but he is on leave right now.  Once it has been updated and I have made an effort to replicate the error, I will email you back.
Thanks!
Ram Shukla
