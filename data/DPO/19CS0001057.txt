Body of Original Email:
Hello everyone

Since the OTP is not being used, can the Client re-enter her correct mobile number?

For the customer mentioned above, when she was reclaiming 2x $10 Cheaptan voucher, she entered the wrong mobile number without knowing it and was not able to get an OTP to verify the voucher. 


She has got in touch with Cheaptan and was advised to get help from VUQ instead.

Please help us remove this mistake and customer can get her $20 Cheaptan voucher?


Thank you
Larry
