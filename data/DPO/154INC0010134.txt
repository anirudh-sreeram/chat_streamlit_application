Regarding INC2193863: [Mountgust TMN] - [Issue gaining access to the Mountgust website; no drawings or attachments are available]

[10:56 PM] Arya, Nitish Kumar
 Mountgust is operational; the only problem we can identify is with search for which Ram is currently collaborating with CTC. We want to recommend using advance search in the meanwhile.

 Advance search snapshot

[Yesterday 10:57 PM] Kennedy, Terrance
To locate CAD drawings, do we need to utilize advanced search?

[Yesterday 10:58 PM] Arya, Nitish Kumar
the problem will be fixed as soon as possible, but in the interim, we must use advance search as a workaround. We really appreciate your patience

[Yesterday 10:58 PM] Kennedy, Terrance

[Yesterday 10:58 PM] Arya, Nitish Kumar
by default, search is enabled using a name or number.
