Hi Ana,

I did not find the Jose Rivas loan certificate using the email given below.  Could you submit the Edicta certificate number on this file?  If the certificate is cancelled and restorement is not allowed, the premium received will be refunded.  We will require a copy of note and current payment history to review for restorement.

Thanks and Regards,

The $89.10 delivered to you overnight today by FEDEX for Brian Money.  Sending for your attention, you should receive tomorrow.


Now Jose Rivas has 2 more checks. These are loans we have taken from Academy home Mortgage. They seems to be in this premium paying arears. we are not liable to repay these loans until March 2022. Since then we have sent you 6 payments (2 being returned this week).  So I now consider this to be restored as well?

Attached checks copies.  Our loan #15009615822.

Hi Ana,

I am sorry for any confusion on this certificate.  The certificate has been cancelled due to non payments,  so our system will automatically refund any premiums for the loan in this case until the restorement is approved.

This certificate recognizes the establishment and it is flagged that no premium will be refunded to you. The premium required to restore the certificate is $267.30. Currently $222.75 is suspense. We need the balance of $89.10 to complete the recovery. Send the balance to complete the refund. Edicta cannot hold the funds for more than 30 days, so please pay balance amount and we will bring it back to active status for you.

Yes because every time I send a check they are returned by your office. I got another one today.  I cannot send $267.30 at once when funds have already been processed and sent to you.  It is obvious that one office is not communicating with other office.  I don t understand why this is happening only to this one borrower of ours.  We have other borrowers with you who seem to have been processed without problem.
