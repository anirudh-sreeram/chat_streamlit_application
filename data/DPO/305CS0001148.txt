Hello Shawna,

In the future, please include the lenders service mailbox in the correspondence. Yes, we will be able to proceed with processing the refunds once the rates have been applied. Aisha will be responsible for managing the refund process.

Hi Patrick,

I apologize for interrupting, 

I have been attempting to contact Nate. It seems from his Outlook status that he might not be in the office. 

I was wondering if you or someone else on the team could assist me with the correction population of seven loans. I have been receiving pressure from sales/ADMs to complete these corrections. Would lender services be able to provide refunds for the difference in premium payments for any payments made if the AC applies a special rate to this?

Hi Nate,

I apologize for bringing this up once more, but I am under some pressure from the sales/ADMs department to correct the remaining Certificate and issue a refund if Freda applies special rates. Could lender service process a refund for the difference in premium if any have already been made?

Subject: RE: Shield This is a follow-up to the voice mail I left earlier this morning.   

Hello everyone,

After speaking with Freda Tran regarding these correction requests for refunds, I have discovered an option to activate this customer on GenRATE. This would enable the system to provide the "planned rate" for each loan mentioned below. 

Freda Tran would be able to rerun the commitments and update the rate almost automatically.

Nate - Would adopting this approach allow you to update the rates on the Certificates and not complicate the refund process? 

Please share your thoughts so that we can choose the best path between:

1. Retroactively enrolling HDFC Bank for the originally planned GenRate card, without the need for special rates (at least for commitments).
2. Utilizing special rates for the entire loan population mentioned below.

Additionally, Freda informed me that you may not have received this email due to the Deskflow case structure. If you prefer, we can connect over the phone to provide more context and work on a solution together.

Regards,

-Shawna

Hello Fanny,

Certainly, I have already added the Action Portal and Lender Services to this thread about this change request..

+AP and Lender Services

We need to make corrections to the rate and refund any overpaid premium (if applicable) for 9 certs/commitments from HDFC Bank (68WD). This issue arose because the customer's company ID was unintentionally omitted from the GenRATE cards during a previous rate change. The planned rates mentioned below are the GenRATE rates that these loans were supposed to receive. 

Here are the details of these 9 loans where the correction is required.

If we were to utilize the "planned rates" indicated in the green sections above by using special rates for these Certificates and obligations, any excess premium paid would be refunded if there have been loan payments involved.

Please inform me if you have any inquiries or require further information regarding this correction request. 

I appreciate everyone's assistance with this matter. 

-Shawna


Just a further notice - there is another Lender that experienced significant impact from this, so there might be a separate group of 24 loans that require correction depending on how the lender responds to our proposal to fix those rates.

Fanny, here is Cristina Noble's response regarding the issue with commits/certs receiving rate card rates instead of GenRate rates. She proposes offering borrowers the planned rates and has questions regarding references and how they will be handled. Additionally, she mentions waiting for October's premium, which is en route, before issuing refunds. We are unsure of the preferred course of action, but please feel free to email your response directly to Cristina Noble and include me and others in the communication with her. Regards,  Mable

Hi Mable,


We intend to provide our borrowers a more favorable rate. For the active Certificates, will the bank receive a letter indicating the amount refunded to the borrower from Shield?

Additionally, a wire transfer will be made soon to pay the October MI invoice. It would be advisable for you to wait until the payment has been processed on your end before issuing the refunds.

Cristina

Hello Cristina,

I previously left you a voicemail regarding a technical problem related to some of your recent commitments/Certificates. During an audit, we discovered that our system applied rate card costing instead of GenRate costing. Here is a list of the affected items for your reference. I wanted to inform you and give you the opportunity to update all the rates to the planned rates and have new commitments or Certificates reissued, if necessary. If there were any overpaid premiums, we will refund them accordingly. Some items have already been activated with loan close dates, while others are still awaiting MI activation. If you prefer to leave them as they are, we can accommodate that as well. We will take the action you deem appropriate, and I apologize for any inconvenience caused. Please contact me when you have a free moment.  Regards, Mable Villarreal  800-876-4342
