A case was opened with a short description of Licensing problems in Azure system.
A longer description includes Hello Help Desk,

I'm having licensing issues with our servers in our Azure environment. Our terminal server, domain controllers, as well as the CALs that were added to the terminal server are all now showing as unlicensed.
 
As told to us by Myedon Logistics (the original vendor we were using before this tenant was transferred to Nimbus), we have these licenses that we were permitted to bring into the environment.
 
Subscription ID: 64d2726-ed0b-56dd-0120-4076fc720d75

If you need any additional information, please let me now so I can provide it. I can be reached via email or the phone number below.

Thanks!

What customer is having this problem? Microsoft told us about a bug. Maybe it's related to that.

We are currently experiencing connectivity issues. However, the two servers were unlicensed, including the CALs for terminal services.

 If it is helpful, I can give you the licenses that were given to me.

When I signed in to look at the terminal server just now, I saw that it is now licensed.

The portion that is the Remote Desktop service remains unlicensed and the following warning appears when I sign in.

At the moment the domain controller is also showing as unlicensed.

Did you get my earlier update? There was a screenshot. Microsofth has confirmed that they are working on a patch for this issue.

Creation date: 2022-09-26 17:26:04 comments: I'm sorry I can't be of more assistance here Gauransh. We currently have a few cases with the same problem. Atmininum, Microsoft is aware of the problem now.
Creation date: 2022-09-28 20:27:50 work_notes: Afternoon Kevin,

I wanted to include you in this case because Gauransh is not in office at the moment. What problems are you having while installing the app? Microsoft informed us that the activation message was a glitch on their end and that your VMs should still be operating with full functionality. Because a few clients have reported the same issue,  I will link that message again below.

If you have more questions, I can put you in touch with Microsoft directly. Unfortunately, because this is a back end issue on Microsoft's side, we would not have all of the answers.
Creation date: 2022-09-28 20:41:15 comments: Sure, please put me in direct contact with Microsoft. Additionally there is Microsoft Licensing to apply to the server instances. Finally, we would like to commit to the instances on an annual basis.

Starting today, if we don't restart the server, we are unable to access the RDS. Then the same problem occurrs a few hours later.

Hello Kevin,
 
Thanks for reaching out to Microsoft Professional Support. I am Giaan Nath and I will be the Support Representative on this incident.
  
I called you today +1 714-197-7322 and spoke with Ashton who told me no one was available and to call back tomorrow morning.
  
According to the information you provided when the case was made, I believe you are experiencing a License issue in your Azure environment. If you could provide me with more information about the problem, that would be great, so I can better understand it.
 
I will call you tomorrow morning to discuss the situation in more detail.

Hi Giaan,

Please get in touch with me. The only Datacenter license available from Microsoft for the 2022 version is in my possession. I just got confirmation from Volume Licensing Support. Please contact me as soon as to discuss a way forward for activating the two remaining Windows 2002 Servers.

Thanks,
