A case was opened with a short description of The servers on Azure are not responding / remain offline.
A longer description includes The majority of Azure servers stopped responding briefly but returned online, with the exception of a few servers. 
Despite attempting several workarounds, the final group of servers are still not coming back online. 
 - I have tried restarting the Windows instance.
- Shutting down and relocating the instance. Reboot
 - Changing the Azure NIC from static DHCP
 - Changing the Azure NIC static IP to temp and then reverting it back
 - Redeploying the server to a different backend Azure host
 - Deleting the NIC and adding a new one

I also consoled into the server to verify the IP address. It's showing up as DHCP and won't accept the static IP address. I attempted to manually assign an address, but it had no effect.

I have noticed that the server has spontaneously come online. I suspect that it may be due to an issue or resolution on Microsoft's backend. If you have access to the tenant, please check if there is any relevant history. However, I don't believe there is much action we can take at this moment.

Azure has informed us of an unreported outage in the Central US region related to E*_v5 VMs. The issue has been resolved by Microsoft. If you would like a RCA from Microsoft, please let us know and we can escalate the case on your behalf. Otherwise, if you are satisfied and do not mind us proceeding with case archival, please inform us.

Hi Margarito,
Hope you're having a nice day!

I am Eric Marc, a Support Analyst from Azure VM who will be assisting you with this service request. Please don't hesitate to reach out to me, referring to the service request number 5304300020705689.

Based on my understanding, you would like a Root Cause Analysis (RCA) for the VMs that were offline on September 20. To gain a better understanding, please provide us with the following information:
- Can you please provide a detailed description of the problem?
- Have any recent changes been made?
- Do you have any screenshots of the problem?
- How were the VMs recovered?
- Could you please provide the name of one of the affected VMs?

It is important to note that conducting the RCA will take at least 7 days for investigation. We will make our best efforts to provide you with the RCA, but we cannot guarantee its availability.

Best,

Hi Leon,

Hope all is well. 

Problem: A random group of virtual machines lost internet connection.(Might be group of Standard_E2_v5 that were affected). 

Analysis after logging in after the event:
------------------------
"Impact Summary: We identified you as one of the customers using virtual machines in the Central US region that may have experienced a sudden loss of connection. This issue only affected deployments that used the newer generation of virtual machine hardware.

Preliminary Root Cause: We have determined that a recent deployment had a code regression, which caused the failures.

Mitigation: We have rolled back the recent deployment to a previous version, which resolved the issue and restored normal service performance.

Next step: We will continue investigating to find the complete root cause and take preventative measures to avoid future occurrences. Stay informed about any Azure service issues by subscribing to customer service help alerts: https://akz.ms/csh-videos for video tutorials and https://akz.ms/csh-alerts for how-to documentation.

We are constantly working to improve the platform and are sorry for any inconveniences caused to you.
Kindly let me know if you have any further questions or need assistance. Have a great day!
