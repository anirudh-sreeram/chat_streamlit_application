Title: NIM5884957 Users attempting to send Purchase Order via BC environment

Description: When attempting to send Purchase Orders from BC, users Eddie and Edith are receiving permission errors. It was working, but after the users were upgraded to Business Premium, it stopped. The email is trying to send out from an email address that belongs to another user. Send-as permissions can be applied, but it'd be great if we could also get the BC permissions working to send as the Current User. Attached a screengrab of the error.

Product: Dynamics CRM

Hi Martin,
 
Thank you for reaching out to Microsoft Support.
 
I am Gina, a Microsoft Support Engineer, and I will be assisting you with your request 3320100010002486.
 
You can contact me using the information in my email signature.
 
I understand an error is occurring that is preventing two users from sending Purchase Orders to customer from Business Central. The error states that the email account being used to send the Purchase Order email is not permitted to send email on behalf of the account specified. This started occurring after the users' licenses were upgraded to Premium.
 
Kindly accept our apology for this.
 
 For further troubleshooting, please provide the following:
  Verify that this is the correct tenant ID: 6d455310-32gfre-4ddd-895rd-ba10eb16f6df
   Did you "Update users from MS365" from the Users list page, after the users were updated to Business Premium? It can be found under "Process" fastab. If not, please update and try again.
  Are the affected users able to send test emails via the Email Account page?
    Is a shared mailbox account being used to send these emails?
 
Once a solution is provided or a workaround is provided, this incident will be considered resolved. The issue will also be considered resolved if an explanation is found or if the issue is determined to be a result of a third party, a known issue, a design choice, or customization settings.
 
Thank you for your continued business with Microsoft.

I won't be available until 8AM PST which should be 10AM CST. Is anyone online now who can assist with this?  The customer really needs to be able to send emails from their BC system.

 You rarely receive emails from mlogan@layaway.net. Know why this is significant
 
Is there any other way to quickly get a response to this?  It s been 5 hours since I emailed and I have not heard anything.

   Did you "Update users from MS365" from the Users list page, after the users were updated to Business Premium? It can be found under "Process" fastab. If not, please update and try again.
Yes, we did this
  Are the affected users able to send test emails via the Email Account page?

I don't know where to do that.
    Is a shared mailbox account being used to send these emails?
No, I don t think so.
 
I have more information here, don't know if it's useful when she receives the error.

 
Can we connect in a remote session soon? The client really needs to send out emails as soon as possible.
 
Thanks and Regards,
