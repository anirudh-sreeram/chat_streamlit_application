A case was opened with a short description of I am unable to natively authenticate an Azure Active Directory (AAD) joined computer to an AAD joined Azure Virtual Machine (VM) anymore.
A longer description includes Hi,

One of our customers is currently facing an issue where they are unable to establish an RDP connection to a computer hosted in Azure. The client's computer is joined to Azure Active Directory (AAD), and the VM  in Azure functions as a server.

We have confirmed that NLA  is disabled on the Azure VM, and IAM  is properly configured for Americers who have access to login via RDP. Additionally, conditional access policies are not blocking the authentication process, as successful attempts are being logged.

To troubleshoot, we have made modifications to the RDP icon by including the following lines:

authentication level: i:1
enablecredsspsupport: i:2

After including these lines, the user is now able to reach the Windows login screen. However, their credentials are not being passed through automatically, and they need to manually enter their username along with 'AzureAD\' as a prefix in order to log in, even though we specified this in the RDP connection request.

We kindly request your assistance in investigating and resolving this issue.

Thank you for contacting us. I tried contacting you regarding this issue. Is the connection problem occurring on only one specific machine? Can the client successfully connect to Azure using RDP on any other devices?
Creation date: 2022-10-01 01:34:10 comments: Hello Eric,

I have attached a couple of articles that might be helpful. Have you attempted to add the AzureAD/username to the local Remote Desktop Users group?

Do you still require assistance? If so, could you please provide me with a phone number where I can reach you? In the meantime, I will update the case status to High temporarily.
Creation date: 2022-10-01 08:51:44 comments: Support,

I did not receive any incoming calls. Please feel free to call my cell phone number 681-483-6247.

I added a test user to the local group. This is not a requirement that we have encountered in the past, and our environments have been functioning seamlessly for several years. In this specific scenario, it did not have any noticeable impact.

We are wondering if Microsoft altered the authentication process yesterday, as it appears to be affecting multiple customers. 

Additionally, this issue is affecting our ability to access files from a file share on a computer that is joined to Azure AD via a VPN connection.

I have taken the initiative to escalate this issue with Microsoft. You have been added to the case and an email confirming the same should have been sent to you.
Creation date: 2022-10-02 02:01:32 comments: I have not received any emails. Could you please confirm that they are being sent to me and not to Anita?

Additionally, could you please ensure that this issue is marked as Critical?

Dear Eric and Group,
 
I had a conversation with Anita yesterday, and I am free today to have a meeting. Initially, I suggested having the meeting at 11:30 noon, but I need to reschedule it to 12:00 p.m. due to another conflicting appointment. 

If you prefer to continue working on the issue at 10:00 p.m. EST, I can ensure that an analyst will be available during that time to resume from where we left off. 

Our main priority is to prioritize your needs as our client. Please let me know if these adjustments align with your requirements.

Regards,
Jane Summer
