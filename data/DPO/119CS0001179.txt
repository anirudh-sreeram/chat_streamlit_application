A case was opened with a short description of cannot install
A longer description includes Partner contacted to inquire about a possible provisioning problem with this order. After speaking with TS at first, they were forwarded to the vendor, who informed them that the sub showed as cancelled on their end. 
I need an update as soon as possible because the partner and their customer are scheduled to install a device tomorrow.

Hi Juan Reid-Gibbs,

Case # 01776005 "Error with Activation" has an update from your support rep.

Latest case commentary:

Hi Juan,



I'm Madeline Tyler, and I am responsible for handling your case. My working hours are Wednesday through Saturday from 7AM - 4PM. (PT). Please call if you need assistance outside of my working hours at +1(876) 231-3430 (in the US or Canada) or +1(205) 612-0455 (international) to speak with the next Customer Support Rep.



I appreciate your call today, and for discussing the device serial number C0150FF2B-7C66.



 We have verified that the device is sourced from your distributor and is being billed through CLOUDSPACE on a monthly basis rather than as an MSSP device. After investigating, it appears that the device is appearing as inactive. I apologize for misspeaking, but it's conceivable that the contract isn't set up to activate even though it hasn't been terminated.


As a result, you will need to reach out to CLOUDSPACE regarding the device, and you are not going to be able to activate it under your Lightarc (ACC-1447534) account for your client. They may also request the purchase order number or invoice and will help you prepare the license for activation. If you have any concerns, please reach out.




We appreciate you contacting Shieldtick Customer Service.

Creation date: 2022-10-10 20:42:33 comments: Hello Juan,

I wanted to provide a brief update to let you know that our provisioning team has verified everything is fine on our end and has initiated contact with Shieldtick to determine the source of the disconnection. We are seeing the order was successful and the active status of the subscription.

Hope all is fine with you! I didn't want to call just now because it's still early, but Shieldtick informed us that the problem stems from the device not being activated yet. I thought that was what you were attempting to do.  Could you please elaborate on the specific difficulty you are seeing while attempting to activate the device? This will allow us to make sure you are receiving assistance from the appropriate sources for your setup today.


Best,

We appreciate you sending us those screenshots, and we have informed Shieldtick of the problem; they are trying to find a solution. The most recent information that Shieldtick sent our support staff is shown below.
Quick update: In our system, the identical serial number is in fact linked to a cancelled or suspended subscription. 
   Thus, the group is investigating a solution. Devices under subscription are not returnable. When new information becomes available, I'll give it.

Best,

A brief update: In our system, the identical serial number is connected with a previously cancelled/suspended subscription. 
  As a result, the team is investigating possible solutions. That's a first, because subscription devices cannot be reused.
Will offer another update as soon as it is ready.

Hello Julius,
 

Given that Juan successfully signed in yesterday, according to the activity records, he already has a portal account. Perhaps all he needs to do is change his password?
