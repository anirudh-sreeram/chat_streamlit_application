Creation date: 2022-10-08 03:50:15 comments: Hi Mabel,

I have just contacted  Microsoft regarding this matter and a support engineer will be assigned soon.
Creation date: 2022-10-08 05:11:56 comments: Still nothing from MS but there is an update on our end. It's working again. I checked the DNS for the Azure network because some other users were reporting different versions of the same issue. I got rid of the old DC which used to be the CA. i booted up the fresh host and we can all login now. Unsure if the problem was fixed because of first change or the second or a combination of the two changes

The CA issue still needs to be resolved but at least users back in and working in AVD

Nice to hear. I contacted them earlier so they could respond sometime tonight. Either way, I will leave the ticket open for now.

Morning,

Checking in as we haven't heard anything yet. We were last informed on Thursday evening that a Microsoft engineer would be assigned to our case, but we did not hear anything over the weekend, so it remains pending. This is still urgent, so please provide us with updated information as soon as possible.


Thanks,

Hello, Jane. Could you please collaborate with @Patrick Robertson to address the issue? The domain controller was mistakenly decommissioned but necessary steps to decommission the CA first were not completed first. As a result, we are now dealing with issues caused by this oversight and need to resolve them promptly. 

Mabel

Hello Freda,

This is Jane Runson from Microsoft Directory Services, and I hope you're doing well. I have been assigned to your ticket and would be delighted to assist you. 

Kindly refer to the article on decommissioning a Windows enterprise CA - Windows Server | Microsoft Learn. 

The article provides a comprehensive guide on how to revoke outstanding certificates and complete other necessary tasks to successfully install a CA without impacting your current environment.

Please review it and inform me if you require any further assistance.

I eagerly await your response. Thank you!

Hi Team,
 
I apologize for the delayed response as I have been occupied with consecutive meetings throughout the day. 

The earliest time I am available tomorrow is 11:00 PM MST. Please inform me if that suits you, and I will send you a Teams meeting link. 

Regarding your issue, there are limited choices available. The only option is to restore the decommissioned CA from a backup. Once your environment is recovered, you can proceed with the appropriate decommission process that I mentioned in my previous email. 

I eagerly await your response. Thank you.
