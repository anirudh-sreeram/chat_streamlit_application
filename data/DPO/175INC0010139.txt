Creation date: 2023-04-24 14:36:23 comments: There is only a link to ameren.com, not through Frevvo, according to Kacie Mason of the Privacy team. We considered constructing it from scratch using Frevvo, but CustOps opted against it. Please forward it to me and Andrew Walls, the project's CustOps representative, for follow-up.

Creation date: 2023-04-25 14:03:26 comments: This is just for clarification. This is about Data Privacy Consent for ASP and the Frevvo link that was sent by our Wellcomm vendor, so that our cusomers can consent to enroll into ASP for Data Privacy.

Hello Raymond   Could you maybe identify someone who can assist in resolving this issue from the vendor side? Here's the reference to the broken Frevvo Email link for Data Privacy consent.
Please refer to the attached document.
Thank you.

Best wishes,
Rehan

Adding Rajan for awareness. 

According to what I gather, the problem has been solved. Is that true?

We also want to know what the root cause of the problem was. Who is investigating that, do we know?

Thank you everybody!
Tomas
