Subject: Re: Follow-up on the Temporary Program

Hi Hajra,

I hope you are well.

I am reaching out regarding the email below to see if there was any word on the temporary labor and immediate hire program. I'm trying to call you but can't get through. I'd like to schedule a conversation since we have experts in IT, non-IT, administration, clerical work, financial services, engineering, call centers, and light industrial work, customer support, purchasing, marketing, distribution, and staffing. We are highly interested in collaborating with you on a temporary labor program in these areas.

Please advise on how we can provide additional details about the services we offer. I'm looking forward to hearing from you.

Thanks & Regards
Alison Dillon
