The case was mistakenly closed as a result of a mix-up with a similar case number. The MSFT case is still open and we are adding Jackie and Raju for visibility.

Hi Team,

Apologiez for the delayed response. I have been occupied with consecutive meetings and my first available time slot is tomorrow at 11:00 p.m. MST. Please let me know if this time works for you, and I will send you a Teams meeting invitation. 

Regarding the issue at hand, there are limited options available. The only viable solution is to restore the decommissioned CA from a backup. Once your environment is recovered, you can proceed with the appropriate de-provisioning process that was shared in my previous email. 

I eagerly await your response. Thank you.

Hello Okany  Please collaborate with @Jane Liu on resolving this issue. The domain controller was accidentally decommissioned without following the necessary steps to decommission the CA. Currently, we are working on rectifying and resolving the issues caused by this incident.

Hi Moinudeen,

My name is Okany Summer and I am part of the Directory Services team at Microsoft. I hope you are doing well. I have been assigned to your case and I am here to provide assistance.

I would like to refer you to an article on Microsoft Learn that provides guidance on decommissioning a CA decommission a Window Enterprise CA on Windows Server. 

This article explains the steps to remove any outstanding certificates and complete other necessary tasks to uninstall a CA without impacting your current environment.

Please take the time to review the article and let me know if you require any further assistance.

Thank you and I look forward to your response.

I hope everything is fine. I contacted the Premier support line regarding this issue and they assured me that they will reach out to the assigned agent on this case. They will contact you through this email thread as well as via phone number 949-878-9697. I will keep an eye on this matter, but please inform us if you don't receive a call from MFST within the next two business hours.
Creation date: 2022-10-19 18:52:58 work_notes: Waiting for MFST update

It might be necessary to contact Anita and ask CSAM to examine this.
Creation date: 2022-10-20 14:25:45 work_notes: Hi Jane, I hope you're doing well. 

We had a discussion regarding the need for a CA in your environment. Only you are able to determine if a CA is necessary since we do not have enough information. 

If there is no backup or system state for the CA, there will be no way to recover it. In this case, you may need to implement a PKI if necessary. 

We recommend that you reach out to your CSAM, who is included in this email, to schedule a CE visit. This visit will allow us to assess your environment and create an action plan based on your specific requirements. 

If you have any further questions or need assistance, please feel free to let me know.
 
Regards,
