Hello Gregory,

We regret to tell you that your request for wireless headphones, reference number RITM0508880, has been canceled because the mobile number provided was an invalid company number. The mobile number you entered is 615-488-5162. 

I notice from your comments that you need these to return to office again.  Are you trying to find a headset for your laptop?



Thanks,
