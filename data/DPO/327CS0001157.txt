George-Actually, the loan amount needs to be $505,228 but the one we received is having $505,229 .
Is that correct Lin? Don't we require the Assurance cert loan amount to compare what we have?

Thank you very much Richie,

Actually, it is looking like a hand typed agreement where we managed to adjust the loan amount and Assurance Premium. It was forwarded at 12:00. After being paid up front of 70 cents still the agreement is showing a total of 2,079.70 only. 

Still, If you feel it is incorrect what we have submitted to you kindly let me know.

Thanks a lot!
