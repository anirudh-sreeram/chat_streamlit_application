Could you perhaps try turning on the AVD's Start on Connect feature once more?

Would you be able to try using the Azure Virtual Desktop's Open Azure Monitor?
You may access Azure Monitor for Azure Virtual Desktop using one of the options listed below.

Visit aks.microsoft/avdi.
From the Azure portal, search for and choose Azure Virtual Desktop, then click Insights. From the Azure portal, search for and choose Azure Monitor. Select Insights Hub from the Insights menu, then Azure Virtual Desktop. Once the page is open, enter the subscription, resource group, host pool, and time period of the environment to be monitored.

Please send me the logs and any findings so that I can thoroughly investigate the problem.

Thank you,

Creation date: 2022-09-28 18:18:46 comments: Hello Jakob,

I appreciate the logs. I don't notice anything out of the ordinary with the users that made Start on Connect stop functioning on that AVD.
I don't want to waste any more time, so I believe the best course of action at this point would be to contact Microsoft's support directly to ask them to check whether the patch is feasible on their end.


I need to know if you would prefer to communicate with Microsoft mostly by phone or email before I can begin working on that issue. Which phone number is the most convenient for them to call you at?

I can build this case for you as soon as I obtain the information!

Thank you,

Cyrus

In order to keep the Microsoft escalation proceeding as planned, I will also be assigning the Cloudspace issue to our Vendor Assistance team. We will be in contact with another Cloudspace engineer soon.

Hello Jakob,

Validation(ring=0) HostPool should only be used for testing; production environments should not utilize it, hence I would advise against it. In order to minimize any damage, new Windows Virtual Desktop capabilities are enabled initially in the validation environment (ring=0), and features are added to the production ring (ring=1) only once a function has been approved for release.

(+) Louie, AVD Subject expert. 

Hi Jakob,

We learned that the issue you are experiencing was recently detected in validation ring 0 and looks to be addressed now after working with some of the internal product specialists. However, based on your current version: 1.0.4444.600 (Installed on 20220805), even though you went to validation ring 1, the agent hasn't been updated on the AVD VM, which might explain why going to validation ring 1 didn't help address the issue.



Considering the PG team recently solved the issue, could you please put the following modifications into practice and let me know how it turns out? If the problem persists, I'm going to let our PG team look at it.

Procedure: 
1.  Transfer the Hostpool to validation ring 0.
2.  Turn off the updating of the scheduling agent.
3.  Make sure the AVD agent receives the automatic update. 
4.  Attempt the 'Start VM on connect' option. 

Thank you,
