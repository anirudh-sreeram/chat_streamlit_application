A case was opened with a short description of Data processing is lacking in Kubernetes deployment.
A longer description includes The notes from our last call are included below:

Kobe is developing a Python implementation of Kubernetes; he has supplied specifications for the environment (compute, CPU, memory, etc.); it deploys without issue and appears to be in good condition; nonetheless, it becomes stuck when it tries to parse data.
Has max 10k replicas on it so, should be able to spin up. 
It can spin up since it has a maximum of 10,000 copies on it. 
I believe he said there was proof that it worked sometimes but not usually.
The quantity of data going through it is minuscule. (This could be the Microsoft ticket.)
They were issued a ticket (which I can't find) that MSFT marked as addressed (as the primary problem was rectified).
They need to look into why computing assets aren't always available even if they do have them and are being charged for them.




Creation date: 2022-10-11 14:05:50 comments: Good afternoon Kobe,

I am Jago from Cloudspace Technical Support, I hope everything is good with you.

As per our agreement, this is the ticket pertaining to the Kubernetes deployment's incorrect treatment of the data you sent. Miah has the other ticket for Zac's problem, and this will be the only ticket for resolving this particular issue.  That being said, I'll close the other identical tickets right now. 


Since he is more acquainted with the circumstances and surroundings, Miah will be taking over for you on this ticket and serve as your point of contact going forward.

Once again, I appreciate your time earlier.

Best regards,

Jago

Microsoft has reopened case (5000099122092300) and they have a call planned with Jakob for 15:30.

How did this turn out? I haven't seen any updates on the email chain. Was anything agreed upon?

Thank you,

Miah

Hello Kobe,

There appears to be an Internet outage here unfortunately; it is expected to be resolved this evening. Can we move the meeting to tomorrow? I had planned for it to happen today.

 It's rare that you receive an email from kobem@optimalflo.com. Find out why this matters.

Hello Phyllis, Can we arrange a meeting to talk about this? Thank you, Kobe

Hello Phyllis, 

thank you. 

I used the azure ml python sdk to construct an aks service. It functions, however I can only send a limited amount of data through before receiving the following error.

Try-outs for Virtual Machines include  

Standard_D1_v2
Standard_D2_v2
Standard_D4_v2

3 cpus and 8gb memory.

But they all produce the same error. 

Six big language models (1 GB each) are used in the deployment. 

I'd be delighted to guide you through the code.

What do you think the next step should be, a phone call?

Kobe

It appears that you have brought up another issue with your Kubernetes deployment - CS4744964. Since we can only have one case per issue, I will have to close that one.

Were any modifications made to the deployment before this problem?

Hello,

I must submit a support request.

Kubernetes deployments that previously functioned properly no longer run. There is no error notice, and nothing occurs.

Kobe
