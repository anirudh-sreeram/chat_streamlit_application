Shield Lender Services,

Kindly verify the receipt of the special rate letter and check for processing the revised MI certificate reflecting the reduced rate. Additional information is provided in the attached document.

We need to make adjustment within our LOS and import the updated MI certificate into our system to enable the integration of the new certificate. We plan to do this promptly to activate the insurance with special MI rate.

This includes the closer as well.

We have received approval for the MI. I have just submitted the buydown request, and we will need to process this info to issue a check to Shield for the rate buydown. Once we have that completed, we can proceed to update IMPAR activate the MI.


Starting tomorrow, I will be away, and I want to keep everyone informed. Kira, I have included you in the information sent to shield as an alternative contact in case we need to retrieve the updated certificate with the reduced rate and imported back into IMPAR. Our main task should be to monitor the status and ensure that they can send us the updated certification with the lower premium.

Hello David,

The original underwriter is no longer employed by public bank. 

I am currently in ongoing discussion with the MI company to ascertain whether they will grant approval. I am expecting to receive their response today. If they approve, we will need to proceed with a rate buydown, as the loan was closed with a lower monthly MI amount then the current code we have received.


I will be away starting tomorrow and I am hoping to receive some communication, ideally an approval, today. If we do obtain approval, I will still need to request the rate buydown, but it's essential to ensure they grant approval first.

Regards,

Billy,

Hello,

The loan is lacking a copy of the MI certificate. What we currently have in the system are only quotes. Kindly provide the necessary documentation. This loan was closed on 09/25/2022, and the customer needs to have a currently active policy in place.
