A case was opened with a short description of Register a collective grievance or complaint by submitting a ticket. 
A longer description includes Shirley Bryant informed me that another applicant, Junior to myself, had been chosen for the PM position. I want to know why a less experienced candidate would be chosen over me. I have 25 years of experience and completed a two-year contract with SNI in the position for which I was being employed. I think it's wrong if my age had a role in the decision, and I'm worried that it did.

Contact Ashleigh Russell if you have any questions about this situation. Carmen Mcdonald complained that Shirley Bryant had passed him over for the senior IT project Manager (R54934) position because of his advanced age. Ashleigh's reply to him is in the email that is attached. Later, Carter Mendez spoke with him today. He's waiting for HR to get in touch with him. He might be satisfied with the explanations Carter gave him for why he wasn't chosen, but if he isn't, it may be necessary to launch an investigation to discover who was considered, who was chosen, and whether any potential prejudice occurred. 
I won't be there the following week, but Jillian is the one who brought the issue to my attention and asked if HR could back it. You're the best support, in my opinion, since he's in Austin. I greatly appreciate it. Kenny

Hi Carmen-

I'm writing to you in response to a query you sent on the Sr. IT Project Manager hiring choice. As far as I can tell, Carter Mendez in Talent Acquisition provided comments on the hiring choice after you spoke with her. I'm checking in to see whether your queries have been addressed and/or if you would like to speak with me about the issue.

Thank you,
