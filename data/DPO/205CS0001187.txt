A case was opened with a short description of CloudBeast - support issue
A longer description includes Timmy,
Next week, I will require some form of license credit. I am currently engaged in a mailbox and document migration, and we have encountered a licensing issue solely due to error in the migration process. Despite opening a case with CloudBeast, the assistance has been unsatisfactory, and time is of the essence. I am compelled to purchase an additional 100GB SharePoint migration license (even though it shouldn't be necessary) to proceed with migrating the same data. I will certainly need a credit for this in the coming week.

Appreciate it.


Regards,

Creation date: 2022-10-10 20:25:10 comments: Yes, I obtained the service from Nimbus, unaware that I could initiate a tech support ticket for Migration Wiz via the provided number. Consequently, we opted to open a ticket directly with CloudBeast, and the experience was less than satisfactory.

In short, I encountered two issues. First, a mailbox migration failed at 80%, and despite opening a ticket for guidance on a graceful recovery and avoiding mailbox duplication, I received no response until today (post migration).
The second, more significant issue involved a OneDrive to SharePoint documentation migration. We purchased a 100 GB document license for a total data volume of 64GB. Strangely, MigrationWiz reached 100GB and halted, citing max capacity constraints. Despite opening a case, the response was unsatisfactory. In a time crunch, I had to purchase another 100 GB license, use it, and then redo the migration, which finally proved successful.

In essence, the second license I had to purchase should be refunded, as it was a clear calculation error on their part that they could not address in a timely manner.

Please inform me if this clarification is helpful.


Creation date: 2022-10-10 21:20:44 comments: I apologize for the inconvenience. Let's work together to find a solution.

Support is copied here, and a ticket has been generated. I will proceed with submitting a refund request, and we now have documentation regarding this issue.

Hello, 

This is how the license operates. It is the responsibility of the partner to be aware of the size of each SharePoint library and purchase the appropriate number of SharePoint document licenses. I have also observed that our team reached out to the customer to offer further assistance. The partner contacted us on Friday at 3:10, and we responded by Friday at 6:20. I don't see any delays and the customer purchased an additional license to cover the project. There doesn't appear to be any reason to process an RMA for the license.

I can't approve this request based on the prompt response by support to the customer and the success of the migration.

The partner encountered a failed mailbox migration at 80%, he opened a ticket for recovery guidance but did not receive a timely response. Another issue arose when migration wizard reached 100 GB, but it stopped, indicating that the maximum capacity was reached. The partner opened a case for this issue but did not receive a satisfactory response, leading them to purchase another license due to time constraints.

Hello Tina, I had a conversation with the partner, and he expressed dissatisfaction with the response. Essentially, he believes he priced it correctly for a 60GB migration, purchasing 100GB SKU. This is the first-time migration wiz did not work for him. The issue wasn't related to the data volume but arose due to a technical error, significantly impacting his project. Dissatisfied with the cloudbeast support, he opted to repurchase the SKU. When he tried another 100 GB SKU for the same exact data it worked.
Creation date: 2022-10-20 12:08:31 work_notes: I am in consultation with Jamie Atkinson to determine if this is a technical issue and to discuss the approach for submitting the credit request. The credit request has not been submitted at this time.
