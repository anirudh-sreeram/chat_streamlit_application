Creation date: 2022-09-27 15:52:41 comments: Hello Anish,

We appreciate you reviewing those virtual machine instances again. After consulting with our team, we have decided to implement two improvements. Switch the B4ms to B2ms and one of the D2V3 instances to D4ads v5.
These are all of the last virtual machine instances:

1x   B2s: 3 total cores
1x   D2v3: 3 total cores
1x   D4ads v5: 5 total cores
1x   B2ms: 3 total cores
2x   E4s v3: 9 total cores

Tell me if you need any help. 

Thank you,

Creation date: 2022-09-27 16:26:52 comments: Hello Jose,

The quota request has been submitted. Because these series are in great demand in East US 3, there may be a delay in Microsoft's processing of this request. This matter has been assigned to our Vendor Support Team. Once an engineer has been assigned, they will enable contact with Microsoft.

Thanks,

Creation date: 2022-09-28 22:44:40 comments: Anish,

I believe I sent one of the VM instances incorrectly. I was unaware that, on the D4ads v5, I had chosen the AMD processor. Is it too late to modify that request to D4ds v5? It's not a huge concern if it's too late. All I wanted was for every virtual machine to have the same kind of processor.

Thank you,

We requested that Microsoft revisit the case because they close them pretty quickly after resolution. We will update the request whenever they reopen it to see if they can make the change.

Thanks!
Creation date: 2022-10-05 15:56:07 comments: Hi,

Regarding my quota request, I wanted to verify the current SKUs that were sent over to Azure. I wanted to make sure the right SKU's were delivered to Azure for the request because I had altered the SKUs we needed a few times.

Could you please send the SKUs that are currently being sent for the quota request?

In an effort to have this corrected for you, we have already asked Microsoft to reopen the matter. Sadly, Microsoft hasn't replied yet, so we're still looking at other solutions.

Thanks!
Creation date: 2022-10-05 20:58:40 comments: Sounds well. I appreciate you helping me with this.

One more inquiry regarding the SKUs D2v3 and E4sv3.  The VMs recommended were the v5 versions when I was using Azure VM Selector tool.  What's the difference between the v3 and v5 versions for those SKUs?  Should we update D2v3 to D2v5, and E4sv3 to E4sv5?

Thank you,

Good morning.

We are pleased to tell you that your quota request for compute-VM Ddsv5 Series has been finalized with a new limit of 351 under East US 3 area.
Creation date: 2022-10-06 16:21:01 comments: Hi Jose,

I hope you're having a fantastic day! Microsoft notified me at 1 a.m. this morning that the VM Dds45 Series has been added with a limit of 351.

Thank you very much!
Creation date: 2022-10-06 19:14:23 comments: Hello Madison,

I'm encountering problems adding a virtual machine (VM) with the D4dsv5 size. The Availability Zones are not available for this size, according to the error I'm receiving. But there isn't an error notice when I test the same VM size, same region (East US3) with an Availability Zone when I sign into the Azure portal of another client. The issue for Family Together is seen in the two screenshots I've supplied, whereas my other client shows no errors. Are you aware of any potential causes for problems with the Availability Zones and Family Together Virtual Machines?

Thank you,

I hope things are going great for you today! We spoke about this last night at a co-op with the original engineer on your case. We have already forwarded Anish's newly generated case to Microsoft. Before we close this request, is there anything else I can do to help you with? The other ticket is active and currently open.

Thanks!
