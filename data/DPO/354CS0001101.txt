Hello,

On November 21, 2022, I mistakenly placed an order for Vouchers with your company, totaling  1840. I promptly contacted Vendora to clarify the situation and request a refund. Initially, they refunded  140 and assured me that the remaining  1700 would be returned. However, this refund has not materialized. I have spent the majority of this morning communicating with both your team and Vendora, but have mostly received unhelpful emails from Vendora instructing that you should be responsible for issuing the refund.

I have decided to discontinue my attempts to reach out to you because I consistently encounter unhelpful responses, and it seems that no one is able to assist. Whenever I attempt to access the vouchers, I receive an error message stating  not valid , error code FHJGU-WEF-0-401

I request a refund of my funds and kindly ask for someone to contact me by phone.

Thank you for giving us this information. 

The provided order number does not seem to belong to us. If you bought the magiccard cards and have the card numbers on hand that would expedite things. 

Kind Regards,
