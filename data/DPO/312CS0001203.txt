A case was opened with a short description of Enabling SMB over QUIC on Azure for Windows Server 2022 resulted in an error.
A longer description includes Hello,

I believe this ticket will need to be escalated to Microsoft, as I am confident that not many people have attempted to use SMB for QUIC, which is exclusively available on Server 2022 Data Centre for Azure with Windows Admin Centre. 

As you can see in the screenshot below, I am consistently encountering the same error, regardless of how many times I deploy a fresh VM. 

Here are a few important points:
1. I have reinstalled a fresh instance of Server 2022 on Azure multiple times in my efforts to troubleshoot the issue myself.
2. I have installed all Windows updates to ensure I have the latest version of Windows Admin Centre.
3. I have followed all the guides available on the internet, including the articles mentioned below.
4. I have extensively searched for information on SMB over QUIC, but couldn't find any mention of this specific error. It seems that not many people have experimented with this feature.
5. I have used valid certificates from Dreamhost and even attempted to create an internet certificate authority, following a video tutorial precisely.
6. After exhausting all my options, I have decided to seek assistance from Microsoft.

Hi Jackie, 

Issue: Configuration of SMB over QUIC is failing
Error: Unable to configure SMB over QUIC
Cause: Not applicable
Troubleshooting Summary:
- Attempted to install the SMB over QUIC feature on a Server 2022 VM
- Verified that all necessary certificates for SMB over QUIC were present and correct
- Windows Server 2022 Data Centre Azure edition is being utilized
- Ensured that UDP 443 traffic is allowed from the Azure portal
- However, the configuration of SMB over QUIC continues to fail
- The error received is: "Could not configure SMB over QUIC. Remote exception: Cannot create a file when the file already exists"
- Attempted to resolve the issue by uninstalling and reinstalling the Windows Admin Centre and properly configuring SMB over QUIC, but the problem persists
- Tried the same configuration on different machines, but encountered the same error message
- Manual configuration also resulted in the same error message
- Informed the client that additional time is required to research the issue, as this is a new implementation
- Research is needed before proceeding further. 

Next steps:
As we discussed on the call, please provide us with the Procmon log and network trace for further analysis. To capture the network trace, please use the network monitoring tool.

Here are the steps to follow:
1. Start Procmon.
2. Start the network trace.
3. Reproduce the issue (e.g., create a share, click configure, click enable).
4. Stop Procmon.
5. Stop the network trace.

Please find the links below to download the required tools:
- Procmon: Windows Sysinternals | Microsoft Learn
- Download Microsoft Network Monitor 3.4 (archive) from the official Microsoft Download Center.

After capturing the logs, please upload the files to the designated workspace.
