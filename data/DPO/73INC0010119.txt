4       What application do they have a problem accessing? What application do they have a problem  accessing?   Cognizant is intermittently showing errors in converting job orders 
5      Brief description of the reported problem. The case will not be converted to a work order when they try to do so
6       Is this a problem that has already been reported and resolved?      Uncertain
7      How many agents are experiencing the problem?     The problem has come up at least once for each agent working overnight (6), and it persists when agents log in
8      Have these agents had access to the applications in the past? Or Are they newly starting agents?    They have previously been able to finish the affected task
9      Does the agent's unavailability affect the customer's overall wait time before connecting with the agent?       After a certain amount of time, we follow the MABI Robotic procedures for urgent orders and create cases for those that can't be completed. This affects how much time we handle while waiting for a conversation to work on an order
10      The problem may it be seen in both places, or is it location-specific?     Since the error, Finja has not logged in
11      When did the problem start        11:30:00 AM
12     If a particular agent is experiencing the problem, ask them to restart the system, log in, and try again.     It has persisted through restart and is not specific to any one agent
13      Check the workstation's speed using a speed test to see if the agent is receiving a good download speed (Above 55 MBPS).  Please collaborate with the Hire Well IT team to diagnose the network if it is low.       Up speed 13.86
Down speed 22.82
14      Coordinate between OAK and OCA to call Ameren Support Desk to open 1 incident (they will want to know % of agents impacted in both sites
