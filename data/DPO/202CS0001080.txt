Body of Original Email:
Hello Settlement Services,
Our content coordinator Glorious is moving away from Snapdeal and we will start the settlement with Glorious in February of 2023. As a vendor coordinator the standard operating procedure is to first get configured in the Glorious system. Directions are enclosed. I can assist with any coordinator related queries you may come across.

Note:  If both Cardly AU and Cardly New Zealand have their own tax ID numbers, separate processes will need to be completed for them. 

Thanks and Regards
Bruno

Hello Bruno,

According to me this might be assigned to trade billing?

@Settlement Services<mailto:Settlement.Services@cardly.com>
Do you know if Glorious Sports has a Trade RE account? This information would be needed to pay.


Thanks,
Myla

Hello Myla,

I remembered you assisted with the accounts payable setup for this vendor in the past. They want us to fill out the form that is enclosed since they are switching over to a more direct model. I just signed on with Cardly, so I hope you can help me out. It involves W9 info, tax info, etc.

Let me know which team might be able to assist.

Thanks and Regards
Bruno

Hello Bruno,

I hope you are well. Please find directions for setting up a new vendor with Glorious Sports attached to this email. In order to make sure we receive timely payments, we need this info as soon as possible. Please remember that there are two separate processes that need to be successfully completed for them to be properly registered. One process is through the Goodle portal (supplier registration) and the other is through Tax Persona (Tax Interview). Kind reminder, please remember to print/download the tax form generated in STEP 1, sign and date it and include it with the registration; OR you can enclose your own signed copy.


Note:  If both Cardly AU and Cardly New Zealand have their own tax ID numbers, separate processes will need to be completed for them. 

Thanks and Regards
Jenny
