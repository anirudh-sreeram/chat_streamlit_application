Hi Tyrese,

Hello!!

Hi, I'm Ebony and I work as a Service Delivery Associate at Tech Services LLC. I wanted to get in contact with you to schedule a brief call to discuss how Tech Services can assist with your program's employment requirements. Kindly inform me.

To overview Tech Services (Business Information Attached): Tech Services LLC wishes to see whether there is a fit and a shared interest with ZScalar because we have been a top provider on several initiatives including ActOne Group, Paylocity Corp, secure vision, and Monster Worldwide. For information technology, non-IT, medical care, facilities technology, transportation, medical equipment, doctors, etc., we are able to obtain solid profiles. We firmly believe in inclusion and diversity and embrace it not just within our own groups and traditions, but also when providing ability, variety, and temporary employment to our customers. At the moment, 31% of our entire workforce is multicultural.

The sets of abilities that my group handles for our customer are listed below. (The accompanying PDF has a complete list.)

*             Application Development: JAVA/Microsoft/Net
*             Data Management & Analytics
*             Agile Program Management
*             Cloud, Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Services
*             ERP/CRM Packages - SAP & Salesforce
