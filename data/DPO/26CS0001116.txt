Hello Kelly,

The public bank currently has a MP with us, but they have not included our step in their encompass system so far. They are in the process of transitioning to work with lender solution, a part of MNO mortgage and will be adopting MNO encompass while discontinuing their direct association with encompass. What are steps should I take to enable David s shield credential for use with MNO encompass?

Should you have any inquiries, I will be in the vehicle between approximately 8:30 AM - 11:00 AM today.

Regards,

Alia

Public bank is a fresh addition to lender solutions, and they are also a mutual client of ours. They are in the process of transitioning to our encompass platform and will require specific credentials for mi ordering through encompass. I have included David in this e-mail, and if necessary, he can request these credentials. The bank currently possesses credentials for their existing setup in encompass that must remain active.

Kim, please review Alia s e-mail below. I wasn't entirely clear about whether she still wants us to establish BCT's with their own encompass credentials. So, I spoke with her, and she explained that MNO operates both as a retail operation and provides lender solutions to smaller businesses. MNO will underwrite the loan but will close it in BCT's name and then sell it to MNO lender. She wasn't certain if it is an option for BCT to utilize MNO encompass credentials or if they need their own, given that the loan will be closing in BCT's name. As a result, she is organizing a conference call with the customer and I advised her to include you, just in case there are additional questions that I may not be able to answer.
