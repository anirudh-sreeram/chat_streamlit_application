A case was opened with a short description of RE: Billing problems concerning Lorelai Peak [NIM3761477]
A longer description includes Luke,

I should have replied earlier, but I was under the impression that I was waiting for Nimbus  response. I never received the credit or the outreach from the finance team that you mentioned regarding the credit.

The credit was authorized and reflected on your August invoice, and you can find it on the final page. I have included the invoice for your reference. If you have any more questions please feel free to ask. Wishing you a great day.
Creation date: 2022-09-19 20:56:52 comments: Are we referring to the same matter? The screenshot you provided displays a credit related to an issue with E3 from 2/26 to 4/11, which was on an invoice sent to me even before we delved into the core of this problem.

The credit should pertain to the period from 5/30 to 7/31.

Hello Team, 

The partner has followed up again on this request and wrike- https://www.wrike.com/open.id=953254460
It appears that the request was cancelled due to being a duplicate, but I cannot find any credit on the September statement?

There was a credit issued in August, but it pertains to a different SKU and a different time period. Can you please verify whether it has already been processed or if it is still needs to be added to their invoice?

Thank you for contacting Nimbus support. I have already been in touch with our development and finance team, and they are currently conducting an audit to rectify the pricing discrepancy. They will be issuing a mass credit on your October invoice. Please keep an eye out for the credit on your October invoice. If you have anymore questions do not hesitate to ask. Have a wonderful day.

Hello Team, 

I am following up on this matter. I wanted to confirm if the automatic credit for the price change on the October invoice is still being processed?

Hello Luke, 

Greetings on this Tuesday. This was canceled due to being duplicate as we are actively working on a resolution. The credit for this will be reflected on the October invoice. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
Appreciate it.

Hello Luke and Team, 

Following additional discussions, I have been advised that the credits will now be reflected in November billing. There was a miscommunication that led to the file not being released, preventing the credits from being applied. If any of your partners raise concerns directly, please inform me, and I will do my best to assist with any escalations. However, it is important to manage expectations and anticipate the credits to be posted in November. If you have any inquiries, don't hesitate to reach out.

*** PLEASE NOTE THAT THE MANUAL CREDITS ARE BEING HANDLED ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS ***

Appreciate it,

Creation date: 2022-10-18 17:50:14 comments: Hello Bob, 

I apologize for the delay. Our development team could not resolve the bug in time for the October invoice, so it will be included in the November invoice instead. Rest assured, it is our top priority and will be the first issue addressed this November. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask, but there is no action required on your end. Have a wonderful day.
