I have attached an image of the partner relations tab in the MSFT 365 Admin Centre, which shows that only Cloudspace is currently displayed.

To assist Windmere Electric in providing delegated admin privileges to FabTek Corps, I have included a resource below. This resource will provide step-by-step guidance on how to grant the necessary privileges.

Thank you for your time during our call today.

I hope you are doing well.

I see that the impacted user is okanym@compuprotect.com and the case was created from the wrong tenant. As a result, I am unable to proceed with my testing in the backend as requested. I kindly ask that you please create a ticket from the correct tenant, and I will be more than happy to assist you.

Hi Jane,

I hope you are doing well,

Thank you for reaching out to Microsoft Partners Technical Support. My name is Nihanth G and I am the support professional assigned to handle your ticket 2408230740207973. You can contact me using the information provided in my signature below.

Based on the information provided, I understand that there has been an issue with inviting customers to the Partner portal. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. Rest assured that I will do my best to assist you effectively and work towards resolving the issue as quickly as possible.

I attempted to call the number +1 749-528-2363 but reached your help desk instead. I was informed that you were busy. Could you please share a preferred time frame for contact so that we can move this case forward?

Issue: Inability to invite customers in the Partner portal.

Possible cause: Admin agent role missing in user account.

Current status and suggested Action Plan:
As per the reported issue, you are unable to view customers in the partner portal. We kindly request you to follow the provided information and provide an update on the situation.

Cause-1 - Insufficient permission for customer management. Need role: Admin Agent

Resolution: 

We have explained that in order to manage customers, users would require the "Admin Agent" permission. The Global admin role grants the highest level of access within your organization, and the admin agent role provides similar functionality on behalf of other tenants, such as customers.
We suggest the following steps:

[https://partners.microsoft.com] > Console > Settings (top-right corner) > Account Settings > User Console > Select desired user account from the list > Enable the option: "Assist Customers as" and choose "Admin Agent" from the dropdown menu> Update the settings using your Global admin account.

Please wait 3 to 4 hours, sign out, and sign back in. You should then be able to view the customer tab without any issues.

We have confirmed that the admin agent role has been successfully assigned to your user account, granting you access to the customer management feature in the Partner Portal. 

Here is additional information that may be helpful:

- Overview of Partner Portal permissions 
- Guide on how to invite a customer to establish a reseller relationship with you 
- Learn how to partner with indirect providers via the Cloud Solution Provider program

Cause 2: Issue specific to the browser

Resolution:

Attempt to access the Partner Portal portal using Incognito mode and log in with the admin agent credentials.

Kindly request you to clear cookies and cache, as well as passwords.

Relaunch the browser and sign in to the Partner Portal using the admin agent credentials.

Cause 3: Inability to view the complete customer list on Partner Portal

Resolution:

Log into Partner Portal and navigate to Customer list. Locate the toggle button "View all Advisor relationships" in the top-right corner just above the tab labeled "Search Customer list".

Toggle the button to the right above the search bar. Refresh and see if you can view the complete customer list.

If you cannot see the toggle button, please access the Partner Portal using the browser in Incognito mode.

If the toggle button is displaying in Incognito mode, then clear the cookies and cache, so that you can see the button in the normal browsing mode while accessing Partner Portal.

Please let me know how things are progressing.

Thank you for choosing Microsoft. We value your business.
Please take care and have a wonderful day ahead.

Thank you very much for your response.
 
Since you said that you currently only have the global admin role assigned, we would like to guide you through the steps to assign the admin agent role to your account in order to assist customers effectively. Please follow the steps mentioned below to complete this process:

  Depending on the task, a user needs "Admin Agent/Helpdesk Agent/Sales Agent" permission. The Global admin role grants the highest level of access within your organization, and the admin agent role provides similar functionality on behalf of other tenants, such as customers.
  Log into [https://partners.microsoft.com] > Console > Settings (top-right corner) > Account Settings > User Console > Select desired user account from the list > Enable the option: "Assist Customers as" and choose "Admin Agent" from the dropdown menu> Update the settings using your Global admin account.

  I kindly ask for your patience and request that you wait for at least 24 hours for the permissions to be reflected in your user account. Please keep in mind that there may be a propagation delay, and it is necessary to update the browser cache/cookies.
  In the meantime, you can also attempt to access Partner Portal through an incognito browser window after a few hours to verify if the changes have been implemented.
  If you still do not see the changes after 24 hours, we can attempt to resolve the issue by clearing the old browser cookies/cache files, which will update the changes on your browser.

Please let me know how things are progressing.

Thank you for choosing Microsoft. We value your business.
Please take care and have a wonderful day ahead.

Hello Jane, 


I hope you're having a good day.

I am checking in regarding your support ticket, number (SR #2408230740207973), with Microsoft Partner Portal Technical Support.

I attempted to contact you at +1 749-528-2363, but I reached your support instead. They informed me that you were unavailable at the time.

I would like to inquire whether you had a chance to perform the suggested steps. If you did, kindly respond to this ticket and inform us of the outcome or the current status of the issue. This information will support us to track the progress of the ticket and further investigate if the issue persists. If there is anything else I can assist you with, please don't hesitate to let me know. I will be happy to address any additional concerns you may have. If you are currently occupied with other work priorities or require more time to get back to us, please keep me informed.

In the event that you have no further inquiries and the problem has been resolved, kindly inform us if we can move with closing the ticket.
